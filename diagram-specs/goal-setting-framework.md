# Client Goal-Setting Framework Diagram

## Purpose

Visualize the 12-week DEXA-informed client management cycle as a horizontal timeline, from baseline scan through goal setting, training with mid-course adjustments, re-scan, and review. Above the timeline, a reference table shows realistic 12-week body fat reduction targets grouped by starting body fat percentage. The viewer should internalize the cyclical scan-train-rescan workflow and understand that targets vary by starting point. The diagram reinforces that weight alone does not capture the full story of composition change.

## Visual Layout

**Canvas:** 800 x 400px, landscape orientation. Background: #F8F8F8.

### Overall Structure

Three horizontal bands:
- **Top band (y: 75-160):** Target reference table.
- **Middle band (y: 180-300):** Main timeline with milestone markers.
- **Bottom band (y: 320-380):** Key takeaway message.

### Main Timeline (y: 180-300)

**Timeline spine:**
- Horizontal line from x: 60 to x: 740 at y: 230. Stroke: #1C3133 2.5px.

**Week markers (small vertical tick marks along the timeline):**
- Ticks at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 positions. Each tick is a vertical line (12px tall, stroke: #1C3133 2px) extending downward from the spine at y: 230 to y: 242.
- Week labels below ticks: "Wk 0" at x: 60, "Wk 4" at x: 286, "Wk 8" at x: 513, "Wk 12" at x: 740, all in 10px #7C8D90 at y: 256.

**Milestone 1: Baseline Scan (x: 60, y: 185-295)**
- Circle marker (r: 16px) centered at x: 60, y: 230. Fill: #46C9F7 (blue). Stroke: #1C3133 2px.
- Icon inside: A small simplified body outline or scanner icon, represented as a vertical line (12px) with two short horizontal lines crossing it (like a DEXA beam), stroke: #FFFFFF 2px.
- Label above: "Baseline Scan" in 12px bold #1C3133, centered at x: 60, y: 195.
- Sub-label below (beneath the week marker): "Establish metrics" in 9px #7C8D90, centered at x: 60, y: 272.

**Milestone 2: Goal Setting (x: 160, y: 185-295)**
- Circle marker (r: 14px) centered at x: 160, y: 230. Fill: #FFFFFF. Stroke: #69D994 2.5px.

**Training Phase (x: 200-700):**
- The timeline spine between Goal Setting and Re-scan is styled differently: stroke: #69D994 2px, with a semi-transparent green fill band (8px tall, centered on the spine, fill: #69D994 at 15% opacity) to visually indicate the active training period.
- Label centered above this section: "Training Phase" in 13px semibold #69D994, at y: 185, centered at x: 400.

**Adjustment Markers (at weeks 4 and 8):**

- **Week 4 adjustment (x: 286):**

## Sizing and Responsiveness

- SVG viewBox: "0 0 800 400".
- The horizontal timeline layout fits naturally in wide content containers. The three-band vertical organization keeps the diagram compact.
- At narrow widths, the timeline compresses but the milestone markers and their labels remain the primary readable elements. The target table may become tight below ~500px but the bold target values remain readable.
- The 400px height is intentionally compact to avoid overwhelming the content page; the diagram serves as a quick-reference framework, not a standalone document.

## Accessibility

- **Alt text:** "Horizontal timeline showing the 12-week DEXA goal-setting framework. A reference table at top shows 12-week targets by starting body fat percentage: above 30 percent body fat targets a 3 to 5 percent reduction with fat loss priority; 20 to 30 percent body fat targets a 2 to 3 percent reduction with a balanced approach; below 20 percent body fat focuses on recomposition with lean mass and body fat percentage shifts. The timeline runs from Week 0 to Week 12 with five milestones: Baseline Scan at Week 0 to establish metrics, Goal Setting to set 12-week targets, Check-in adjustments at Weeks 4 and 8, and Re-Scan at Week 12 to measure changes, followed by a Review and Reset cycle. A key message states that weight alone does not tell the story and to track composition, not just the scale."
- **SVG title element:** "12-week DEXA client goal-setting framework timeline with targets by starting body fat percentage."
- **No color-only encoding:** Every milestone is labeled with text (name and description). The target table contains numeric ranges, descriptive focus labels, and BF% headers. Week markers are labeled numerically. The check-in diamonds have text labels. The key takeaway is fully textual. Color is used to categorize (blue for scans, green for training, yellow for check-ins, red for high BF%) but every element has a complete text description.
- **Contrast:** #1C3133 text on #FFFFFF table: exceeds 15:1. #1C3133 text on #E5F6EB header: exceeds 12:1. #1C3133 text on #FFF8E1 key takeaway: exceeds 12:1. #E87D7D text on #FFFFFF: ~4.0:1 (meets AA at 12px bold). #F5C842 text on #FFFFFF: ~1.9:1 (low -- consider using #D4A72C or increase weight; alternatively, these BF% range headers are supplementary to the numeric target values in #1C3133). #69D994 text on #FFFFFF: ~2.5:1 (same consideration as #F5C842). #7C8D90 text on #FFFFFF: ~5.5:1 (meets AA).

## Design Notes

- The timeline metaphor makes the cyclical nature of DEXA-informed training immediately clear: scan, set goals, train, check in, re-scan, repeat. The dashed return arrow from Re-scan emphasizes this is not a one-time event.
- The target table at the top provides the reference data that trainers need during goal-setting conversations, positioned prominently so it is the first thing seen after the title.
- The color coding for BF% ranges (red for >30%, yellow for 20-30%, green for <20%) creates an intuitive severity/urgency gradient that matches clinical intuition.
- The check-in diamonds at weeks 4 and 8 are styled differently from the major milestones (diamonds vs. circles) to communicate they are adjustment points, not major events.
- The blue color for both Baseline Scan and Re-Scan reinforces that these are the same type of event (DEXA measurement), bookending the training phase.
- The key takeaway bar at the bottom restates the core message from the content section: composition matters more than weight. This is intentionally placed last so it functions as the parting thought.
