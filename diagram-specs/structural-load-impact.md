# Structural Load Impact Diagram

## Purpose

Illustrate how body composition directly affects the musculoskeletal system by contrasting the mechanical effects of excess fat mass versus adequate lean mass on a simplified anterior body outline. The viewer should immediately understand that excess fat creates compressive, destabilizing forces on the spine, knees, and ankles, while adequate lean mass provides stabilization, joint support, and balanced load distribution. This reinforces the chiropractor's clinical reasoning for integrating DEXA data into MSK assessment.

## Visual Layout

**Canvas:** 800 x 550px, landscape orientation. Background: #F8F8F8.

### Overall Structure

The diagram is divided into three vertical zones around a central body outline:

- **Left zone (x: 30-280):** Excess fat mass effects (negative/harmful forces).
- **Center zone (x: 280-520):** Simplified anterior body outline with highlighted spine.
- **Right zone (x: 520-770):** Lean mass benefits (positive/protective forces).

A vertical dashed divider separates left and right conceptual zones through the body center at x: 400, from y: 90 to y: 500. Stroke: #DFE2E2, 1px, dash 4,4. This divider is subtle and runs behind the body outline.

### Central Body Outline (x: 280-520, y: 100-490)

A simplified, gender-neutral, symmetrical anterior human silhouette centered at x: 400.

**Body outline:**
- Stroke: #1C3133, 2px. Fill: #FFFFFF at 50% opacity.
- The outline is schematic (not anatomically detailed): head circle (r: 25px, centered at x: 400, y: 120), neck, trapezoidal torso (shoulders at y: 165, waist at y: 310), arms (simple tapered rectangles angled slightly outward from shoulders to y: 340), pelvis/hips flaring slightly (y: 310-350), legs (two tapered rectangles from hips to y: 480), feet (small rounded rectangles at y: 480-490).
- Total silhouette height: ~390px.

**Spine highlight (center of torso):**
- A vertical line of 7-8 small rounded rectangles (each ~12px wide x 8px tall, rx: 2) stacked vertically with 4px gaps, centered at x: 400, from y: 170 to y: 340.
- Fill: #46C9F7 (blue accent) at 70% opacity. Stroke: #1C3133 1px.
- This represents the vertebral column in a simplified manner.

**Joint markers:**
- Three pairs of small circles (r: 6px) at key joint locations, fill: #DFE2E2, stroke: #1C3133 1.5px:
  - **Lumbar spine:** Single circle at x: 400, y: 300 (larger, r: 8px, fill: #46C9F7 at 40%).
  - **Knees:** x: 370 and x: 430, y: 400.
  - **Ankles:** x: 370 and x: 430, y: 470.

## Typography

- **Font family:** Poppins, system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif.
- **Title:** 22px, weight 700.
- **Subtitle:** 13px, weight 400.
- **Zone headers:** 15px, weight 600.
- **Label box line 1 (force name):** 12px, weight 600.
- **Label box line 2 (description):** 10px, weight 400.
- **Summary bar text:** 11px, weight 500.

## Sizing and Responsiveness

- SVG viewBox: "0 0 800 550".
- The wide layout accommodates the three-zone design. At narrow widths, the label boxes and arrows remain readable; the body outline provides a central anchor.
- All text remains legible at 50% scale due to minimum 10px font sizes.
- The symmetrical left/right layout creates a natural visual comparison even at reduced sizes.

## Accessibility

- **Alt text:** "Front-view body outline showing the musculoskeletal impact of body composition. On the left, three red arrows indicate harmful effects of excess fat mass: compressive load causing increased disc pressure on the spine, joint stress with a 4-times force multiplier at the knee, and postural deviation from anterior gravity shift. On the right, three green arrows indicate benefits of adequate lean mass: spinal stabilization through core muscle support, joint support through muscular shock absorption, and balanced load distribution through force transfer. The spine is highlighted in blue at the center of the figure. A summary states that excess fat creates compressive and destabilizing forces while lean mass provides stabilizing and protective forces."
- **SVG title element:** "Body composition and structural load: fat mass versus lean mass effects on the musculoskeletal system."
- **No color-only encoding:** Every arrow is paired with a labeled text box that names the force and describes its mechanism. The zone headers ("Excess Fat Mass" / "Adequate Lean Mass") are textual. The summary bar restates the key message in words. Color is used to reinforce the negative (red) vs. positive (green) distinction but is not the sole indicator.
- **Contrast:** #1C3133 text on #FDEDEC (light red) background: exceeds 10:1. #1C3133 text on #E5F6EB (light green) background: exceeds 10:1. #7C8D90 muted text on light backgrounds: ~5:1 (meets AA for small text). Zone header text (#E87D7D and #69D994) on #F8F8F8 background: ~3.2:1 and ~2.8:1 respectively (use semibold weight at 15px to compensate; meets AA for large text).

## Design Notes

- The body outline should be simple and schematic, not anatomically realistic. It serves as a spatial anchor showing where forces are applied, not as a medical illustration.
- The spine highlight in blue draws the eye to the central structure most affected by both fat and lean mass, reinforcing the chiropractic relevance.
- Arrows should curve gently rather than being straight lines, suggesting force pathways rather than static pointers.
- The symmetric left-right layout makes the comparison immediately scannable without requiring close reading.
- The "4x force multiplier at knee" detail from the content (Messier et al., 2005) is included to ground the diagram in specific clinical evidence.
