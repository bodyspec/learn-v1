# Rough Idea: Content Expansion

## Goal
Ensure all modules (including deep-dives) meet two baseline requirements:
1. Every module has **at least 2 sections**
2. Every module has a **quiz**

## Current Gaps

### Modules needing additional sections (currently have only 1):
- **sarcopenia** — "Sarcopenia & Aging" (1 section: "Understanding Sarcopenia")
- **bone-health** — "Bone Health & DEXA" (1 section: "Bone Density Basics")

### Modules needing quizzes (0 of 4 deep-dives have quizzes):
- **sarcopenia** — no quiz
- **bone-health** — no quiz
- **glp1-monitoring** — no quiz (has 2 sections already)
- **visceral-fat** — no quiz (has 2 sections already)

## Constraints
- New content must match the existing style: same quality of sourcing, footnotes & references, diagrams, tone
- This is an expansion of existing content, not a rewrite
- Prefer adding content over restructuring where possible
