# Content Review — Rough Idea

## 1. General Content Review

Review all content and sources, one by one:

- Are all claims well sourced?
- Are all sources active, reachable, and accurate?
- Are there units that are still clearly missing and should be part of any modules?
- Is there any content that should be removed because it is low value or low relevance?

## 2. BodySpec Scan Report Content Review

Review content talking about BodySpec's scan report:

- Compare this against the actual live sample scan; how can we improve and talk about how great BodySpec's scan report is?
- Can we add highlights that show how great it is vs other alternative DEXAs and talk about why BodySpec's implementation is specific and unique?

## 3. Diagrams Review

- Are there missing diagrams?
- If so, can you create detailed specs per diagram which notes (in frontmatter) which page it should go in and the data and details for how to properly design a given diagram for a given page?
