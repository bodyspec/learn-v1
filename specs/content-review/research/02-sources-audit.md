## Key Observations
- Citation quality is high — all peer-reviewed or authoritative sources
- Some files making clinical claims lack citations (e.g., `chiropractor/01-msk-relevance.md` has only 1)
- The "4x body weight during walking" claim in chiropractor module has a source but only one
- `core/01-how-dexa-works.md` makes technical claims about DEXA technology with no citations
- Deep-dives are well-sourced; main modules are lighter on citations
