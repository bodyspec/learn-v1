# Bone Health Referral Decision Flowchart

## Purpose

Guide healthcare providers through the decision pathway for when body composition DEXA bone findings should trigger a referral for clinical bone mineral density (BMD) testing. The viewer should understand the critical distinction that body composition DEXA is supplementary -- not diagnostic -- for osteoporosis, and learn the specific criteria that warrant referral. The flowchart provides a practical, actionable framework based on USPSTF screening guidelines and clinical judgment.

## Visual Layout

**Canvas:** 800 x 550px, landscape orientation. Background: #F8F8F8.

## Sizing and Responsiveness

- SVG viewBox: "0 0 800 550".
- The vertical flowchart is the dominant structure. At narrow widths, the side branches (left advisory box, right risk factor callout) may approach the edges; ensure minimum 20px margin from SVG boundaries.
- The disclaimer box at the bottom is the highest-priority element after the main flow -- it should remain visible and legible even if the upper flowchart details are hard to read at small scales.
- Decision diamonds are sized to accommodate their multi-line text without overflow.

## Accessibility

- **Alt text:** "Decision flowchart for referring patients from body composition DEXA to clinical bone mineral density testing. Starting point: Body Composition DEXA Results. Decision 1: Is whole-body bone mineral content low (below 10th percentile or declining trend)? If no, continue routine monitoring with annual body composition DEXA. If yes, Decision 2: Does the patient meet screening criteria (women 65 or older, men 70 or older, postmenopausal women with risk factors, or adults with fragility fracture history)? If no, discuss risk factors, consider early screening, and monitor BMC trend (amber advisory). If yes, refer for clinical BMD DEXA at hip and lumbar spine sites for T-score based diagnosis (green action box). A risk factors reference lists corticosteroid use, rheumatoid arthritis, parent hip fracture, current smoking, low body weight, height loss, and prior fragility fracture. Bottom disclaimer: Body composition DEXA bone data is supplementary, not diagnostic for osteoporosis."
- **SVG title element:** "Bone health referral decision flowchart from body composition DEXA to clinical BMD testing."
- **No color-only encoding:** Every decision diamond contains the full question text and criteria. Every result box contains a text label describing the action. Yes/No labels on arrows provide textual flow direction. The disclaimer box contains the full warning text. The risk factor callout provides a complete text list. Color is used to reinforce the decision flow (green for positive outcomes, yellow for intermediate, red for warnings) but all information is available in text.
- **Contrast:** White text on #46C9F7 starting box: ~3:1 (compensated by 14px bold; meets WCAG AA for large text). #1C3133 text on #69D994 referral box: ~4.6:1 (meets AA). #1C3133 on #FFF8E1: exceeds 10:1. #1C3133 on #E5F6EB: exceeds 10:1. #C0392B bold text on white disclaimer: exceeds 7:1. White text on #46C9F7 DEXA badge: ~3:1 (small decorative element, compensated by bold weight).

## Data Accuracy

- The screening criteria are based on USPSTF Recommendation Statement on Screening for Osteoporosis to Prevent Fractures (2025 update): universal screening for women 65+, risk-based screening for younger postmenopausal women.
- Men 70+ screening aligns with multiple guideline recommendations (ISCD, Endocrine Society), though USPSTF states insufficient evidence for universal male screening.
- The 10th percentile BMC threshold for prompting further evaluation is a practical clinical guideline, not a formally validated diagnostic cutoff.
- Risk factors listed in the callout are from USPSTF and ISCD official positions.
- The distinction between body composition DEXA and clinical BMD DEXA is a core educational point emphasized in ISCD 2023 Official Positions.
- T-score based diagnosis follows the WHO definition: osteoporosis = T-score of -2.5 or below at the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine.
- The emphasis that body composition bone data is "supplementary, not diagnostic" aligns with standard clinical guidance and the existing content in bone-density-basics.md.

## Design Notes

- The flowchart format was chosen because the referral decision is genuinely a branching process with clear yes/no decision points. This mirrors how a clinician would think through the decision.
- The starting point uses blue (#46C9F7) rather than green to signal that it is a data input (DEXA results), not an action or outcome. This differentiates it from the green referral action box.
- The green referral action box is intentionally the largest and most prominent result, since the primary goal of this flowchart is to guide providers toward appropriate referral when indicated.
- The amber advisory box for patients who have low BMC but do not yet meet screening criteria represents an important clinical nuance: these patients are not yet referral candidates, but they should not be ignored.
- The disclaimer box at the bottom uses red styling (border and bold text) because the body-comp-is-not-diagnostic distinction is the single most important takeaway from this diagram. It prevents misuse of body composition bone data.
- The risk factor callout on the right side provides a quick-reference that supports the Decision 2 diamond without cluttering the main flow. The dashed connector line shows it is supplementary information.
- The "No" path from Decision 1 exits to the right, while the "No" path from Decision 2 exits to the left, creating a visual balance and preventing all side branches from crowding one side.
- Ensure adequate vertical spacing between elements for arrow labels and visual breathing room. The flowchart should feel clean and clinical, not cramped.
