# Patient Progress Visualization Diagram

## Purpose

Show a before/after regional body composition comparison that demonstrates measurable patient improvement over time. The viewer should see that even when total weight is unchanged, body composition can improve significantly -- reinforcing the motivational communication principle that composition changes matter more than scale weight. The diagram provides a concrete visual example chiropractors can reference when framing progress positively for patients.

## Visual Layout

**Canvas:** 800 x 500px, landscape orientation. Background: #F8F8F8.

### Overall Structure

Two simplified anterior body outlines side by side ("Scan 1" and "Scan 2"), with labeled metrics between them showing change direction and magnitude. A summary conclusion box below ties the message together.

### Scan 1 -- Baseline (x: 60-300, y: 80-370)

**Label:** "Scan 1 -- Baseline" in 14px semibold #7C8D90, centered at x: 180, y: 95.

**Body outline (x: 110-250, y: 110-360):**
- Simplified gender-neutral anterior silhouette, centered at x: 180.
- Stroke: #DFE2E2, 2px. Fill: #F0F0F0 (slightly darker than background to give the body shape).
- Head: Circle (r: 18px) at x: 180, y: 128.
- Torso: Rounded trapezoid from shoulders (y: 155, width: 100px) to waist (y: 260, width: 80px).
- Arms: Two tapered rectangles from shoulders, extending to y: 270.
- Legs: Two tapered rectangles from hips (y: 260) to y: 350.
- Feet: Small rounded caps at y: 350-360.

**Regional highlights on the body (semi-transparent overlays):**

- **Trunk region:** Rounded rectangle overlay (70px x 80px, centered at x: 180, y: 210). Fill: #E87D7D at 30% opacity. Stroke: #E87D7D 1px, dash 3,2. This subtly indicates higher fat distribution in the trunk.
- **Leg regions:** Two small rounded rectangles (20px x 60px each) at x: 155 and x: 205, y: 275-335. Fill: #69D994 at 20% opacity. Stroke: #69D994 1px, dash 3,2.

**Metric labels (left side of body, x: 60-105):**
- "BF: 31%" in 11px #E87D7D at y: 195.
- "Trunk lean:" in 9px #7C8D90 at y: 230, "18.2 kg" in 11px #1C3133 at y: 243.
- "Weight:" in 9px #7C8D90 at y: 340, "185 lbs" in 11px #1C3133 at y: 353.

**Metric labels (right side of body, x: 255-300):**
- "Total lean:" in 9px #7C8D90 at y: 140, "56.8 kg" in 11px #1C3133 at y: 153.

### Change Indicators (center zone, x: 315-485, y: 110-350)

**Vertical dashed line** connecting all four rows: x: 315, from y: 120 to y: 330. Stroke: #DFE2E2 1px, dash 4,3. Another at x: 485.

### Scan 2 -- Follow-Up (x: 500-740, y: 80-370)

**Label:** "Scan 2 -- 3 Months" in 14px semibold #69D994, centered at x: 620, y: 95.

**Body outline (x: 550-690, y: 110-360):**
- Same simplified silhouette as Scan 1, centered at x: 620. Identical proportions to emphasize that weight is unchanged.
- Stroke: #1C3133, 2px (slightly more prominent than Scan 1 to suggest the "current" state). Fill: #F0F0F0.

**Regional highlights on the body (showing improvement):**

- **Trunk region:** Same position as Scan 1, but Fill: #69D994 at 20% opacity. Stroke: #69D994 1px, dash 3,2. The shift from red to green overlay on the trunk indicates improved trunk composition.
- **Leg regions:** Same position, Fill: #69D994 at 35% opacity (more saturated than Scan 1, indicating lean mass gain). Stroke: #69D994 1.5px.

## Sizing and Responsiveness

- SVG viewBox: "0 0 800 500".
- The side-by-side body outlines require adequate horizontal space. At narrow widths below ~500px, the center metric zone may compress, but the directional arrows and values remain the key communication elements.
- Body outlines are simple enough to render cleanly at all scales. Regional overlays use opacity rather than fine detail, ensuring they remain visible even at reduced sizes.

## Accessibility

- **Alt text:** "Before and after body composition comparison showing patient progress over 3 months. Scan 1 baseline shows 31 percent body fat, 56.8 kilograms total lean mass, 18.2 kilograms trunk lean mass, and 12 percent limb asymmetry at 185 pounds. Scan 2 at 3 months shows 28 percent body fat (down 3 percent), 58.9 kilograms total lean mass (up 2.1 kilograms), 19.6 kilograms trunk lean mass (up 1.4 kilograms), and 5 percent limb asymmetry (improved, down 7 percent), all at the same weight of 185 pounds. Summary states composition improved while weight was unchanged, highlighting that DEXA tells the story a scale cannot."
- **SVG title element:** "Patient progress visualization showing body composition improvements over 3 months at unchanged weight."
- **No color-only encoding:** All metrics are labeled with text names and numeric values. Change direction is indicated by both directional arrows (triangles) and signed numeric values (+/-). The "improved" label supplements the asymmetry change. The summary box restates all key findings in text. Color reinforces the positive/negative framing but is not the sole indicator.
- **Contrast:** #1C3133 text on #E5F6EB summary: exceeds 12:1. #69D994 text on #F8F8F8: ~2.8:1 (large text at 14px semibold meets AA for large text). #E87D7D text on #F8F8F8: ~3.2:1 (used only for baseline metrics with redundant numeric context). #7C8D90 on #F8F8F8: ~3.9:1 (meets AA for the font sizes used). #1C3133 on #FFF8E1: exceeds 12:1.

## Design Notes

- The two body outlines must be identical in size and proportion to visually reinforce that weight has not changed. The composition differences are shown only through the regional overlays and the metric labels.
- Scan 1 uses a lighter stroke (#DFE2E2) and Scan 2 uses a stronger stroke (#1C3133) to create a subtle "before/after" visual hierarchy, with Scan 2 feeling more present and defined.
- The center change indicator zone acts as a visual bridge between the two scans, making it easy to compare without scanning back and forth between numbers.
- All four metrics show improvement (green), reinforcing the motivational communication purpose. This is a "positive framing" example -- the kind of data presentation that keeps patients engaged.
- The "Same weight" callout in amber/yellow draws attention to the surprising fact that weight is unchanged, which is the key insight of the diagram and the core teaching point of the content section.
