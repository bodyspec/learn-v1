# Muscle Preservation Strategy Pyramid Diagram

## Purpose

Present the hierarchy of interventions for preserving muscle during GLP-1 therapy as a four-tier pyramid. The viewer should understand that the interventions are layered from foundational (protein optimization at the base) through exercise and monitoring to escalation at the top. The pyramid shape communicates that the base layers are the most important and broadly applicable, while the top tier is a narrower, last-resort option. Each tier should clearly communicate its key recommendation with enough detail to be actionable.

## Visual Layout

**Canvas:** 800 x 500px, landscape orientation. Background: #F8F8F8.

### Title Area (y: 0-55)

- Title centered at top.
- Subtitle below.

### Pyramid Structure (y: 80-420)

The pyramid is centered horizontally on the canvas (center: x: 370). It is constructed from four trapezoidal tiers, stacked bottom-to-top. Each tier narrows as it ascends, creating the classic pyramid shape.

All tiers have rounded corners (rx: 6) on their outer edges.

**Tier 1 -- Protein Optimization (bottom, widest) (y: 340-420):**
- Trapezoid shape: bottom edge 580px wide (x: 80 to x: 660), top edge 480px wide (x: 130 to x: 610). Height: 80px.
- Fill: #69D994 (green). Stroke: #1C3133, 1.5px.
- **Tier number:** "1" in a circle (22px diameter, fill: #FFFFFF, stroke: #1C3133 1.5px) positioned at the left side of the tier (x: 100, y: 380). Number in 12px bold #1C3133.
- **Tier title:** "Protein Optimization" in 17px bold #1C3133. Centered horizontally, y: 370.
- **Tier detail:** "1.6-2.2 g/kg/day, leucine-rich sources, prioritize at every meal" in 12px medium #1C3133. Centered horizontally, y: 393.

**Tier 2 -- Resistance Training (y: 250-335):**
- Trapezoid: bottom edge 470px wide (x: 135 to x: 605), top edge 360px wide (x: 190 to x: 550). Height: 80px. 5px vertical gap from Tier 1.

**Tier 3 -- DEXA Monitoring (y: 160-245):**
- Trapezoid: bottom edge 350px wide (x: 195 to x: 545), top edge 240px wide (x: 250 to x: 490). Height: 80px. 5px gap from Tier 2.

**Tier 4 -- Escalation (top, narrowest) (y: 80-155):**
- Trapezoid: bottom edge 230px wide (x: 255 to x: 485), top edge 120px wide (x: 310 to x: 430). Height: 70px. 5px gap from Tier 3.
- Fill: #E87D7D (coral/red). Stroke: #1C3133, 1.5px.

## Sizing and Responsiveness

- SVG viewBox: "0 0 800 500".
- The pyramid shape communicates the hierarchy even at small sizes when text may be difficult to read. The color-coding provides immediate comprehension.
- At narrow widths, the detail callout cards on the right may need to be omitted or collapsed. The tier titles and details within the pyramid contain the essential information.
- All text should remain legible at 50% scale.

## Accessibility

- **Alt text:** "Pyramid diagram showing a four-tier hierarchy of muscle preservation strategies during GLP-1 therapy. Tier 1 (base, green): Protein Optimization — 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram per day, leucine-rich sources, prioritize at every meal; specific recommendations include 25 to 40 grams per meal from whey, eggs, Greek yogurt, and lean meats. Tier 2 (amber): Resistance Training — 2 to 3 times per week, compound movements, progressive overload; specific exercises include squats, deadlifts, presses, and rows at 8 to 12 reps for 2 to 3 sets. Tier 3 (blue): DEXA Monitoring — every 3 months, track appendicular lean mass and composition ratios, including fat-free mass index and lean percentage of total loss. Tier 4 (top, red): Escalation — dose adjustment and specialist referral, including registered dietitian, physical therapist, or endocrinologist if needed. A note at the bottom states: Start from the base — protein and exercise should be initiated before or with medication."
- **SVG title element:** "Muscle preservation strategy hierarchy pyramid for GLP-1 therapy patients."
- **No color-only encoding:** Each tier is numbered (1-4), labeled with its strategy name, and contains descriptive text for the recommendation. The detail callout cards provide additional specifics in text. The "Foundation" and "Escalation" labels on the priority arrow supplement the visual hierarchy. The bottom note provides the key takeaway in text. Color reinforces the urgency progression but is not the sole differentiator.
- **Contrast:** #1C3133 text on #69D994 (Tier 1): ~4.6:1 (meets AA). #1C3133 on #F5C842 (Tier 2): ~6.5:1 (exceeds AA). #1C3133 on #46C9F7 (Tier 3): ~3.8:1 (meets AA for large text at 17px bold; consider darkening to #3AADDD for body text). #FFFFFF on #E87D7D (Tier 4): ~3.4:1 (meets AA for large text at 16px bold; use bold weight for both title and detail text). Detail card text in #1C3133 on tinted backgrounds: all exceed 10:1.

## Design Notes

- The pyramid metaphor is deliberate: the wide base (protein) should feel like the non-negotiable foundation, while the narrow top (escalation) should feel like a last resort. The visual weight of each tier reinforces this hierarchy.
- Tier colors do not imply "good to bad" in the same way as a traffic light. Green (protein) is foundational, amber (exercise) is complementary, blue (monitoring) is evaluative, and red (escalation) is reactive. The color choice reflects the nature of each intervention more than its desirability.
- The detail callout cards add specificity without cluttering the pyramid itself. The pyramid tiers carry the headline message; the cards carry the prescriptive details.
- The connecting lines from pyramid tiers to callout cards should be subtle -- they guide the eye without competing with the pyramid's visual hierarchy.
- The bottom note reinforces the key clinical message from the content: interventions should be proactive (start before medication), not reactive (start after DEXA shows problems).
- The "FOUNDATION" label below Tier 1 is in uppercase with letter-spacing to give it a grounding, architectural feel.
