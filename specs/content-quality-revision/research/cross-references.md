# Cross-Reference Inventory

All instances of inter-section references that need to be removed or reworked during revision.

## Explicit Cross-References (must remove)

| File | Location | Text | Action |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| bone/02-clinical-context.md | Line 3 | "The first section... established" / "This section builds on that foundation" | Re-introduce bone density concepts directly |
| sarcopenia/02-intervention-monitoring.md | Line 3 | "section one covered what and how to identify... this section focuses on what to do about it" | Open with direct statement about intervention purpose |
| glp1/02-preserving-muscle.md | Line 4 | "when patients on GLP-1 medications show concerning lean mass loss on DEXA" | Keep concept but remove implication it was covered elsewhere |

## Implicit Cross-References (review and rework if needed)

| File | Location | Text/Pattern | Action |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| core/04-reading-reports.md | Line 29 | "BodySpec's dashboard highlights these metrics prominently" — assumes reader knows which metrics | Name the specific metrics inline |
| core/04-reading-reports.md | Line 87 | "more granular context than the threshold categories alone" — references thresholds from 03-key-metrics | Briefly explain what thresholds are being referenced |
| physician/02-interpreting-results.md | Line 19 | "the same metrics" — references earlier content | Name the metrics explicitly |
| core/05-misconceptions.md | Line 21 | References density concept from file 01 | Re-introduce density concept briefly |
| trainer/03-tracking-cadence.md | Various | "baseline" assumes knowledge from module 01 | Define baseline in context |
