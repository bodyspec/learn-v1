## Questions & Answers

### Q1: Should the factual/technical content itself change, or is this purely a prose and structure revision?

For example, if a section has accurate information but it's presented as a bare list — should we only reshape the presentation (add intros, narrative flow, transitions) while keeping the same facts? Or are you also looking to add, remove, or update the underlying technical content?

**A1:** Prose and structure revision only. The subjects and factual content stay the same — the goal is better writing, not different coverage. Transform lists into prose, add introductions and narrative flow. The difference will become obvious once all content is read during the research phase.

### Q2: Are tables ever appropriate, or should everything become prose?

Some content (e.g., comparison data, metric ranges, reference values) can be genuinely clearer in a table. Should tables be preserved when they serve a real purpose, or do you want a hard rule toward prose for everything?

**A2:** Tables are fine and should be preserved where they genuinely help (comparisons, metric ranges, reference values). The issue is sections that are *only* tables/lists with no surrounding prose. Every section should read like an article — with introductions, flow, and explanations — where tables support the narrative rather than replace it.

### Q3: How should the "in the previous section..." cross-references be handled?

When a section currently says something like "As we discussed in the previous section, body fat percentage..." — should that concept just be briefly re-introduced in context (e.g., "Body fat percentage, one of the key DEXA-derived metrics, ..."), or should cross-references be dropped entirely with no replacement?

**A3:** Re-introduce the concept in context if the reference is needed for comprehension (e.g., "Body fat percentage, one of the key DEXA-derived metrics, ..."). If the cross-reference isn't needed, drop it entirely with no replacement.

### Q4: Who is the audience for this content, and what tone/voice should the prose aim for?

The platform serves healthcare providers and fitness professionals. Should the tone be formal/clinical, conversational/accessible, or somewhere in between? Is there an existing file you'd point to as the gold standard for voice?

**A4:** Professional tone that balances accessible and authoritative. Not overly clinical, not overly casual. Some existing articles already hit this mark and need minimal revision — those will serve as the gold standard during the research phase.

### Q5: Should the markdown structure (headings, heading levels, callout blocks, etc.) be preserved or can it be reorganized?

For example, if a file currently uses `## Heading` followed by a bare list, can we restructure into different heading hierarchies, add new subheadings, or reorganize the flow — as long as the same topics are covered?

**A5:** Yes, restructuring headings and reorganizing flow is fine. The constraint is maintaining good coverage of the same topics, not preserving the exact markdown structure.

### Q6: Are there any content files that should be left untouched, or is every file in scope?

For instance, are any files still in draft/WIP state where revision would be premature?

**A6:** All 24 files are in scope. No drafts or WIP. Every file should be examined and revised if needed.

### Q7: Are there any image/diagram references (e.g., `![](...)` or asset paths) in the content that need to be preserved exactly?

Want to make sure we don't break any existing asset links during restructuring.

**A7:** Yes, all image/diagram references and asset paths must be preserved exactly.
