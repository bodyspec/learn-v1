    text: "At what VAT area threshold is a patient generally considered to be at elevated metabolic risk?"
    options:
      - text: "50 cm²"
        correct: false
      - text: "100 cm²"
        correct: true
      - text: "200 cm²"
        correct: false
      - text: "300 cm²"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      A VAT area of 100 cm² is generally considered the threshold above which
      metabolic risk begins to increase. Below 100 cm² is considered low risk,
      100-160 cm² is moderate to elevated risk, and above 160 cm² is high risk.

      A 45-year-old male patient has a BMI of 24 (normal range) but his DEXA
      shows a VAT area of 145 cm² and body fat of 28%.

      What is this phenotype commonly called?
    options:
      - text: "Metabolically healthy obese"
        correct: false
      - text: "TOFI (Thin Outside, Fat Inside)"
        correct: true
      - text: "Sarcopenic obesity"
        correct: false
      - text: "Normal weight healthy"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      TOFI (Thin Outside, Fat Inside) describes individuals with normal BMI
      but elevated visceral fat and body fat percentage. These patients have
      higher metabolic risk than their weight suggests and may be missed by
      standard screening that relies only on BMI.

    text: "According to EWGSOP2 criteria, what is the ALM/height² cut-point for sarcopenia in men?"
    options:
      - text: "<5.5 kg/m²"
        correct: false
      - text: "<7.0 kg/m²"
        correct: true
      - text: "<9.0 kg/m²"
        correct: false
      - text: "<10.5 kg/m²"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      The EWGSOP2 (European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People)
      defines sarcopenia cut-points as:
      - Men: ALM/height² <7.0 kg/m²
      - Women: ALM/height² <5.5 kg/m²

      These thresholds help identify patients at risk for sarcopenia-related
      functional decline.

      A patient on a weight loss program has lost 20 lbs over 4 months.
      DEXA shows that 12 lbs was fat and 8 lbs was lean mass.

      What percentage of weight loss was lean mass, and is this concerning?
    options:
      - text: "40% lean loss - concerning, as ideal is <25% lean loss"
        correct: true
      - text: "40% lean loss - acceptable for weight loss programs"
        correct: false
      - text: "60% lean loss - severely concerning"
        correct: false
      - text: "20% lean loss - within acceptable range"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      8 lbs of 20 lbs = 40% lean mass loss. Ideally, less than 25% of weight
      lost should be lean mass. This patient is losing too much muscle relative
      to fat. Interventions should include increased protein intake, resistance
      training, and potentially a less aggressive caloric deficit.

    text: "Which finding on serial DEXA scans should prompt evaluation for occult disease?"
    options:
      - text: "2% increase in body fat over 6 months"
        correct: false
      - text: "1 kg gain in lean mass over 3 months"
        correct: false
      - text: ">5% lean mass loss in 3-6 months without intentional restriction"
        correct: true
      - text: "5% reduction in VAT over 4 months"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Unexplained rapid muscle loss (>5% in 3-6 months) without intentional
      caloric restriction should prompt evaluation for underlying conditions
      including occult malignancy, inflammatory conditions, malabsorption,
      or other systemic disease.

    text: "For a patient on GLP-1 agonist therapy for weight loss, why is DEXA monitoring valuable?"
    options:
      - text: "GLP-1 agonists can cause bone density loss"
        correct: false
      - text: "To differentiate fat loss from concerning muscle loss"
        correct: true
      - text: "To monitor for medication-induced lipodystrophy"
        correct: false
      - text: "GLP-1 agonists increase VAT specifically"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      GLP-1 agonists cause significant weight loss, but it's important to
      determine the composition of that loss. DEXA can differentiate between
      desired fat loss and potentially concerning muscle loss, allowing for
      intervention (increased protein, resistance training) if too much lean
      mass is being lost.

      A 68-year-old woman with history of falls has a DEXA showing low lean
      mass (FFMI <13) and elevated body fat (38%). She has difficulty rising
      from a chair without using her arms.

      What is this condition called?
    options:
      - text: "Obesity"
        correct: false
      - text: "Sarcopenia"
        correct: false
      - text: "Sarcopenic obesity"
        correct: true
      - text: "Cachexia"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Sarcopenic obesity combines low muscle mass (sarcopenia) with excess body
      fat. This condition carries higher functional risks than either condition
      alone. Patients with sarcopenic obesity have increased fall risk, poorer
      surgical outcomes, and higher mortality in chronic disease. Treatment
      requires addressing both the excess fat and the muscle deficit.

    text: "Can whole-body DEXA scans be used to diagnose osteoporosis?"
    options:
      - text: "Yes, whole-body BMD is diagnostic for osteoporosis"
        correct: false
      - text: "No, osteoporosis diagnosis requires site-specific (hip/spine) DEXA protocols"
        correct: true
      - text: "Yes, if the whole-body BMD is below a T-score of -2.5"
        correct: false
      - text: "Only in patients over age 65"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Whole-body DEXA provides general BMD information but is NOT diagnostic
      for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis diagnosis requires site-specific DEXA
      protocols focusing on the hip and lumbar spine using different scanning
      and analysis parameters. Patients with concerning whole-body BMD should
      be referred for proper site-specific osteoporosis screening.
