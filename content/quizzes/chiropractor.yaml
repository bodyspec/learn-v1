    text: "How much additional force per pound of body weight is applied through the knee during walking?"
    options:
      - text: "Approximately 1 pound"
        correct: false
      - text: "Approximately 2 pounds"
        correct: false
      - text: "Approximately 4 pounds"
        correct: true
      - text: "Approximately 6 pounds"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Every pound of body weight adds approximately 4 pounds of force through
      the knee during walking. This mechanical multiplier helps explain why
      even modest weight loss can significantly reduce joint stress in patients
      with lower extremity complaints.

    text: "What level of limb lean mass asymmetry is generally considered significant and worth investigating?"
    options:
      - text: ">3%"
        correct: false
      - text: ">5%"
        correct: false
      - text: ">10%"
        correct: true
      - text: ">20%"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      While 1-5% asymmetry is normal variation, differences of 10-15% are
      noteworthy and may indicate compensation patterns, previous injury,
      or functional issues. Asymmetries >15% are significant and warrant
      investigation of cause and consideration for targeted rehabilitation.

    text: |
      A patient presents with chronic low back pain. Their DEXA shows low
      trunk lean mass, elevated VAT (android fat), and the right leg has
      8% more lean mass than the left.

      Which interpretation is MOST consistent with these findings?
    options:
      - text: "The patient is an athlete with normal training adaptations"
        correct: false
      - text: "Core weakness and anterior weight shift contribute to LBP; leg asymmetry suggests guarding"
        correct: true
      - text: "The DEXA findings are unrelated to the patient's low back pain"
        correct: false
      - text: "The patient needs immediate imaging for disc pathology"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Low trunk lean mass correlates with core instability, which is a
      common contributor to chronic LBP. Elevated android fat shifts the
      center of gravity forward, increasing lumbar spine loading. The leg
      asymmetry (stronger right leg) may indicate the patient is guarding
      or favoring one side. These findings help inform a comprehensive
      treatment plan including core strengthening.

    text: "What does low trunk lean mass on a DEXA scan most likely indicate?"
    options:
      - text: "Elevated metabolic risk"
        correct: false
      - text: "Core weakness that may contribute to spinal instability"
        correct: true
      - text: "Poor cardiovascular health"
        correct: false
      - text: "Bone density concerns"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Trunk lean mass correlates with core muscle mass and stability.
      Low trunk lean mass suggests core weakness that may contribute to
      spinal instability, reduced load tolerance, and chronic low back pain.
      This finding supports prescribing core stabilization exercises.

    text: "How can DEXA data inform exercise prescription for your patients?"
    options:
      - text: "It can identify which specific exercises caused injury"
        correct: false
      - text: "It reveals muscle imbalances and regions needing strengthening"
        correct: true
      - text: "It shows exactly which exercises burn the most fat"
        correct: false
      - text: "It predicts how quickly a patient will respond to treatment"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      DEXA reveals regional lean mass deficits and asymmetries that inform
      exercise prescription. Low trunk lean mass suggests core work is needed;
      limb asymmetries suggest unilateral exercises; low overall lean mass
      suggests resistance training priority. This objective data helps
      target exercise recommendations.

    type: scenario
    text: |
      A patient recovering from a left ACL repair shows 15% less lean mass
      in their left leg compared to their right on DEXA. They completed
      physical therapy 6 months ago.

      What is the best interpretation and recommendation?
    options:
      - text: "This is normal post-surgical variation; no action needed"
        correct: false
      - text: "The asymmetry indicates incomplete rehabilitation; recommend additional strengthening"
        correct: true
      - text: "The patient should avoid all exercise to prevent re-injury"
        correct: false
      - text: "Surgery should be recommended on the other leg to balance them out"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      A 15% asymmetry 6 months post-ACL repair indicates incomplete
      rehabilitation of the affected limb. This degree of asymmetry may
      increase re-injury risk and affect biomechanics. The patient would
      benefit from additional targeted strengthening of the affected leg,
      potentially with physical therapy referral for supervised rehabilitation.

    text: "When scheduling follow-up DEXA scans to track treatment progress, what is typically the minimum recommended interval?"
    options:
      - text: "2-4 weeks"
        correct: false
      - text: "6-8 weeks"
        correct: false
      - text: "3-4 months"
        correct: true
      - text: "12 months"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      A minimum of 3-4 months is typically needed to see meaningful changes
      in body composition that exceed measurement precision. Scanning more
      frequently may show changes within the measurement error, which can
      be misleading. This interval also aligns with treatment plan milestones.

    text: "Why is elevated visceral fat (android distribution) relevant to a chiropractic patient with chronic low back pain?"
    options:
      - text: "It suggests the patient has a genetic predisposition to back pain"
        correct: false
      - text: "It shifts the center of gravity forward, increasing lumbar spine loading"
        correct: true
      - text: "It indicates the patient cannot safely exercise"
        correct: false
      - text: "It has no direct relationship to musculoskeletal complaints"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Central adiposity shifts the center of gravity anteriorly, increasing
      lumbar lordosis and facet joint loading. This mechanical effect
      contributes to chronic low back pain. Additionally, the inflammatory
      compounds produced by visceral fat may contribute to systemic
      inflammation. Addressing body composition through exercise and
      lifestyle changes can improve both the mechanical and metabolic
      contributors to LBP.
