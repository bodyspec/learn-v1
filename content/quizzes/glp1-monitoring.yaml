    text: "What percentage of total weight loss during GLP-1 therapy may consist of lean mass?"
    options:
      - text: "5-10%"
        correct: false
      - text: "10-15%"
        correct: false
      - text: "25-40%"
        correct: true
      - text: "50-60%"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Clinical trial DEXA substudies show that 25-40% of weight lost during
      GLP-1 therapy may be lean mass. The STEP 1 study found approximately
      39% lean mass loss with semaglutide, while the SURMOUNT-1 study
      found approximately 25% with tirzepatide. This range is higher than
      diet plus exercise alone (15-25%), likely driven by significant
      appetite suppression reducing protein intake, rapid weight loss rate,
      and reduced meal frequency.

    type: scenario
    text: |
      A 55-year-old man has been on semaglutide for 4 months. His DEXA
      shows he lost 12 kg total: 6.5 kg fat mass and 5.5 kg lean mass.
      His ALM/height² is 7.2 kg/m².

      What is the BEST assessment of his weight loss composition?
    options:
      - text: "Favorable — he lost more fat than lean mass"
        correct: false
      - text: "Concerning — lean mass loss exceeds 40% of total weight loss and warrants intervention"
        correct: true
      - text: "Normal — all GLP-1 patients lose this proportion of lean mass"
        correct: false
      - text: "Cannot be assessed until 6 months of treatment"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Lean mass accounts for 5.5 of 12 kg lost, or approximately 46% of
      total weight loss. This exceeds the concerning threshold of 40%.
      While some lean mass loss during GLP-1 therapy is expected, this
      proportion warrants intervention: intensified protein intake (1.6-2.2
      g/kg/day), initiation or escalation of resistance training, and
      possibly discussion with the prescriber about dose adjustment. His
      ALM/height² remains above sarcopenia thresholds, but the trajectory
      needs correction.

    text: "When should the baseline DEXA scan be performed for a patient starting GLP-1 therapy?"
    options:
      - text: "After 3 months of treatment to establish a treatment baseline"
        correct: false
      - text: "Before starting medication or within the first 2 weeks of treatment"
        correct: true
      - text: "Only if the patient reports muscle weakness"
        correct: false
      - text: "At 6 months when weight loss has stabilized"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      A baseline DEXA scan should be performed before starting GLP-1
      medication or within the first 2 weeks of treatment. This establishes
      starting body composition, identifies pre-existing sarcopenia risk,
      quantifies baseline VAT for tracking metabolic improvement, and
      measures appendicular lean mass. Without a true baseline, it is
      impossible to accurately assess the composition of subsequent weight
      loss or identify concerning trends early.

    type: scenario
    text: |
      A 62-year-old woman has been on tirzepatide for 6 months. Her DEXA
      shows VAT decreased by 35% and total body fat decreased by 22%.
      However, her ALM decreased by 8% and her grip strength dropped from
      22 kg to 18 kg.

      What is the BEST interpretation?
    options:
      - text: "Excellent results — the VAT reduction outweighs all other concerns"
        correct: false
      - text: "The metabolic improvement from VAT loss is positive, but the lean mass loss and functional decline require intervention"
        correct: true
      - text: "The medication should be discontinued immediately due to muscle loss"
        correct: false
      - text: "These results are typical and require no changes to the treatment plan"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      The VAT reduction is metabolically favorable, but the 8% ALM decline
      combined with grip strength dropping below the sarcopenia threshold
      (16 kg for women) is concerning. This does not mean stopping the
      medication—the metabolic benefits often outweigh lean mass concerns
      when appropriate interventions are in place. The priority is
      intensifying protein optimization and resistance training, and
      discussing dose adjustment with the prescriber if lean mass loss
      continues despite lifestyle intervention.

    text: "What is the recommended protein target for a patient on GLP-1 therapy who is also performing resistance training?"
    options:
      - text: "0.8 g/kg body weight per day"
        correct: false
      - text: "1.0-1.2 g/kg body weight per day"
        correct: false
      - text: "1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight per day"
        correct: true
      - text: "2.5-3.0 g/kg body weight per day"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      The ISSN recommends 1.4-2.0 g/kg/day for exercising individuals,
      and during active weight loss with resistance training, the optimal
      range is 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day for muscle preservation. This is
      significantly above the general RDA of 0.8 g/kg/day. During GLP-1
      therapy specifically, appetite suppression makes achieving these
      targets challenging, requiring strategies like prioritizing protein
      at every meal, liquid protein supplements, and timing intake around
      periods of better appetite.

    text: "Why is resistance training considered non-negotiable during GLP-1 therapy?"
    options:
      - text: "It increases the weight loss effect of the medication"
        correct: false
      - text: "It provides the mechanical stimulus that signals the body to preserve muscle tissue during caloric deficit"
        correct: true
      - text: "It prevents GI side effects from the medication"
        correct: false
      - text: "It is required by prescribing guidelines before starting GLP-1 medications"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Resistance training provides the direct mechanical stimulus that
      signals the body to maintain muscle tissue even during a caloric
      deficit. Without this signal, the body preferentially breaks down
      muscle along with fat. Research shows RT during weight loss reduces
      lean mass loss by 50% or more compared to diet alone, maintains or
      improves muscle strength, and preserves resting metabolic rate.
      If a patient can only do one type of exercise, resistance training
      provides greater muscle-preservation benefit than aerobic exercise.

    text: |
      A 58-year-old patient on semaglutide reports that nausea and food
      aversions have made it difficult to eat adequate protein. She
      currently manages about 50g per day and cannot tolerate meat or eggs.
      She weighs 85 kg.

      What is the BEST approach to address her protein deficit?
    options:
      - text: "Discontinue the GLP-1 medication until protein intake improves"
        correct: false
      - text: "Accept the lower protein intake as unavoidable during GLP-1 therapy"
        correct: false
      - text: "Prioritize liquid protein sources like whey shakes, time intake around lower-nausea windows, and consider a registered dietitian referral"
        correct: true
      - text: "Switch to a plant-based diet to avoid the food aversions"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      At 85 kg, her minimum target during weight loss should be at least
      1.2 g/kg/day (~102g), so 50g is significantly below target. Practical
      strategies include liquid protein (whey shakes are often better
      tolerated than solid food), timing larger protein meals during
      windows of lower nausea (often 3-5 days post-injection), using
      protein powder in foods like oatmeal or soups, and a registered
      dietitian referral for intensive nutrition counseling. Medication
      discontinuation should be a last resort.

    text: "What is the primary reason that early lean mass losses during GLP-1 therapy may overestimate true muscle loss?"
    options:
      - text: "DEXA scanners are less accurate during the first months of treatment"
        correct: false
      - text: "GLP-1 medications cause temporary fluid retention that masks fat loss"
        correct: false
      - text: "Reduced food intake decreases organ mass, glycogen stores, and associated water, which are measured as lean mass"
        correct: true
      - text: "Patients typically gain muscle in the first months before losing it"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Not all lean mass loss on DEXA represents muscle loss. Reduced food
      intake during early GLP-1 therapy leads to smaller GI organ mass,
      depleted muscle glycogen stores (with associated water), and reduced
      excess lean tissue that overweight individuals carry to support their
      body weight. These components are all measured as "lean mass" by DEXA.
      This is why serial scans over 3-6 months provide a more accurate
      picture of true muscle status than early measurements alone.
