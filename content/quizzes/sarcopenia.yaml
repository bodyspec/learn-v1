    text: "According to the EWGSOP2 consensus, what defines 'confirmed' sarcopenia?"
    options:
      - text: "Low muscle strength alone"
        correct: false
      - text: "Low muscle strength plus low muscle quantity or quality"
        correct: true
      - text: "Low physical performance on gait speed testing"
        correct: false
      - text: "Low muscle mass on DEXA regardless of strength"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      The EWGSOP2 framework defines confirmed sarcopenia as the combination
      of low muscle strength AND low muscle quantity or quality (measured by
      DEXA or other methods). Low strength alone is classified as "probable"
      sarcopenia, while adding low physical performance elevates it to
      "severe" sarcopenia. This staged approach emphasizes that strength—not
      mass alone—is the primary clinical concern, because low strength
      predicts adverse outcomes more reliably than low mass in isolation.

      A 72-year-old woman presents with grip strength of 14 kg and an ALMI
      (ALM/height²) of 5.3 kg/m². She can complete 5 chair rises in 13
      seconds.

      How should her sarcopenia status be classified using EWGSOP2 criteria?
    options:
      - text: "Probable sarcopenia"
        correct: false
      - text: "Confirmed sarcopenia"
        correct: false
      - text: "Severe sarcopenia"
        correct: true
      - text: "No sarcopenia — her chair stand time is normal"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      This patient meets all three EWGSOP2 criteria: low grip strength
      (<16 kg for women), low ALMI (<5.5 kg/m² for women), and low physical
      performance. Her chair stand time of 13 seconds is within normal range
      in isolation, but the combination of impaired grip strength, low
      muscle mass, and the overall clinical picture qualifies as severe
      sarcopenia—all three domains affected. This classification warrants
      comprehensive intervention including resistance training, protein
      optimization, and regular monitoring.

    text: "What is the EWGSOP2 DEXA cut-point for low appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) in men?"
    options:
      - text: "<5.5 kg/m²"
        correct: false
      - text: "<7.0 kg/m²"
        correct: true
      - text: "<8.5 kg/m²"
        correct: false
      - text: "<6.0 kg/m²"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      The EWGSOP2 consensus defines low ALMI as below 7.0 kg/m² for men
      and below 5.5 kg/m² for women. ALMI is calculated as appendicular
      lean mass (arms + legs) divided by height squared. An alternative
      metric, ALM/BMI, may be more appropriate for obese patients, with
      cut-points of <0.789 for men and <0.512 for women. Knowing these
      sex-specific thresholds is essential for correctly interpreting
      DEXA results and identifying patients who meet diagnostic criteria.

    text: |
      A 68-year-old man with sarcopenia has been following a resistance
      training program for 14 weeks. His grip strength improved from 24 kg
      to 29 kg, and his gait speed increased from 0.75 m/s to 0.88 m/s.
      However, his DEXA shows ALM increased by only 0.3 kg.

      What is the BEST interpretation of these results?
    options:
      - text: "The intervention has failed because lean mass did not meaningfully change"
        correct: false
      - text: "The DEXA machine is likely miscalibrated and should be rechecked"
        correct: false
      - text: "The functional improvements are clinically meaningful even though the ALM change is within measurement precision"
        correct: true
      - text: "The patient should discontinue resistance training and try a different intervention"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      A 0.3 kg ALM change is below the least significant change (LSC) of
      approximately 500g, meaning it may reflect measurement variability
      rather than true muscle gain. However, the functional improvements
      are substantial and clinically meaningful: grip strength improved by
      5 kg and gait speed exceeded the 0.1 m/s MCID. Strength and function
      typically improve before and more reliably than mass—this is a
      successful intervention.

    text: "What is the minimum recommended DEXA scan interval for monitoring appendicular lean mass during active sarcopenia intervention?"
    options:
      - text: "Monthly"
        correct: false
      - text: "Every 3 months"
        correct: false
      - text: "Every 6-12 months"
        correct: true
      - text: "Every 2 years"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      DEXA monitoring for lean mass should occur every 6-12 months during
      active intervention. The least significant change (LSC) for ALM is
      approximately 500g, and most patients will not gain enough lean mass
      in 3 months to exceed this threshold. Scanning too frequently risks
      over-interpreting measurement noise. Functional tests like grip
      strength and gait speed can be repeated more frequently at 3-month
      intervals.

    text: "What is the per-meal protein threshold recommended to overcome anabolic resistance in older adults?"
    options:
      - text: "10-15g per meal"
        correct: false
      - text: "15-20g per meal"
        correct: false
      - text: "25-30g per meal with 3-4g leucine"
        correct: true
      - text: "40-50g per meal regardless of leucine content"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Older adults require 25-30g of protein per meal containing 3-4g of
      leucine to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS). This
      threshold is higher than in younger adults (~2g leucine) because of
      age-related anabolic resistance. Meals with less than 20g of protein
      produce minimal MPS response. Per-meal distribution matters as much
      as total daily intake—concentrating protein at dinner while under-
      consuming at breakfast and lunch leaves anabolic potential unrealized.

    text: |
      A 75-year-old patient on a supervised resistance training and protein
      optimization program shows a 1.2 kg decrease in ALM over 8 months
      despite documented adherence to both exercise and nutrition protocols.
      He also reports new difficulty rising from low chairs.

      What is the MOST appropriate next step?
    options:
      - text: "Increase the exercise intensity and protein dose"
        correct: false
      - text: "Repeat the DEXA scan in 3 months to confirm the trend"
        correct: false
      - text: "Investigate for secondary causes with labs, imaging, and medication review"
        correct: true
      - text: "Reassure the patient that some muscle loss with age is expected"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      ALM loss exceeding 1 kg over 6-12 months despite adherent
      intervention is a red flag requiring investigation for secondary
      causes. Possible etiologies include occult malignancy, cachexia,
      endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, hypogonadism), inflammatory
      myopathy, or drug-induced myopathy. The combination of rapid loss
      with new functional decline makes watchful waiting inappropriate.
      A full workup including labs (CK, TSH, testosterone) and imaging
      is warranted.

    text: "Why is resistance training the only Level 1 evidence intervention for sarcopenia?"
    options:
      - text: "It is the only intervention studied in randomized controlled trials"
        correct: false
      - text: "It provides mechanical stimulus that signals the body to maintain and build muscle tissue"
        correct: true
      - text: "It has fewer side effects than pharmacological options"
        correct: false
      - text: "It is the most affordable intervention available"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Resistance training provides the direct mechanical stimulus that
      signals muscle tissue to maintain and grow—a stimulus that nutrition,
      supplements, and medications cannot replicate. Multiple systematic
      reviews and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that RT improves
      grip strength, gait speed, and functional performance in sarcopenic
      older adults. While nutrition and supplements enhance outcomes,
      they cannot replace the anabolic signal that progressive resistance
      exercise provides to skeletal muscle.
