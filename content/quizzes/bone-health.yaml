    text: "What does body composition DEXA measure regarding bone?"
    options:
      - text: "Site-specific T-scores at the hip and spine"
        correct: false
      - text: "Total body bone mineral content (BMC) averaged across the entire skeleton"
        correct: true
      - text: "Bone mineral density at the femoral neck only"
        correct: false
      - text: "FRAX fracture risk probability scores"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Body composition DEXA measures total body bone mineral content (BMC)
      in grams, averaged across the entire skeleton. It does not provide
      site-specific T-scores, which require clinical BMD DEXA at validated
      sites (femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, 33% radius). BMC is a
      real physical measurement that provides general skeletal health
      information, but it cannot diagnose osteoporosis or calculate FRAX
      scores, which require femoral neck BMD specifically.

      A 60-year-old woman asks during her body composition DEXA results
      review: "My doctor told me to get a DEXA scan — is this what they
      meant?"

      What is the BEST response?
    options:
      - text: "Yes, this is the same DEXA scan your doctor ordered"
        correct: false
      - text: "If your doctor mentioned bone density or osteoporosis, they likely meant a clinical BMD scan, which is different from this body composition scan"
        correct: true
      - text: "No, your doctor was wrong — you don't need a bone density test"
        correct: false
      - text: "This scan is actually better than a clinical bone density test because it covers your whole body"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      When a doctor orders a "DEXA scan" for bone health, they typically
      mean a clinical BMD scan focused on the hip and spine for osteoporosis
      screening. Body composition DEXA and clinical BMD DEXA use the same
      underlying technology but serve different purposes, use different
      protocols, and produce different clinical outputs. The patient should
      clarify with their doctor which type was intended, as body composition
      DEXA cannot substitute for clinical BMD testing.

    text: "Which skeletal sites are valid for osteoporosis diagnosis according to the ISCD 2023 positions?"
    options:
      - text: "Whole body, ribs, and pelvis"
        correct: false
      - text: "Any skeletal site measured by DEXA"
        correct: false
      - text: "Femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine (L1-L4), and 33% radius"
        correct: true
      - text: "Lumbar spine and calcaneus (heel)"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      The ISCD 2023 Official Positions specify that osteoporosis diagnosis
      requires a T-score of -2.5 or below at the femoral neck, total hip,
      lumbar spine (L1-L4), or 33% radius. These are the only validated
      diagnostic sites. Whole-body BMD or BMC from body composition DEXA
      is explicitly NOT a valid diagnostic site for osteoporosis. This
      distinction is fundamental to understanding the different roles of
      body composition and clinical BMD DEXA.

    type: scenario
    text: |
      A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman's body composition DEXA shows her
      total body BMC is at the 7th percentile for age and sex. She has no
      known bone health conditions and has not had a clinical bone density
      test.

      What is the MOST appropriate recommendation?
    options:
      - text: "Start osteoporosis medication immediately based on this finding"
        correct: false
      - text: "Reassure her that whole-body BMC is not clinically relevant"
        correct: false
      - text: "Recommend she discuss a clinical BMD test with her doctor given her low percentile and postmenopausal status"
        correct: true
      - text: "Repeat the body composition DEXA in 3 months to confirm the result"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      A BMC below the 10th percentile warrants a conversation about
      clinical BMD referral, especially in a postmenopausal woman. This
      finding cannot diagnose osteoporosis, but combined with her menopausal
      status (a key risk factor), it creates a strong case for formal
      evaluation. Body composition bone data is an opportunistic screening
      tool—it identifies patients who need further investigation. Treatment
      decisions require site-specific clinical BMD results, not whole-body
      BMC data.

    text: "At what age does the USPSTF 2025 guideline recommend universal BMD screening for women?"
    options:
      - text: "50 years"
        correct: false
      - text: "55 years"
        correct: false
      - text: "65 years"
        correct: true
      - text: "70 years"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      The USPSTF 2025 recommendation statement recommends universal BMD
      screening for women aged 65 and older (Grade B recommendation).
      Postmenopausal women under 65 with increased risk should undergo
      clinical risk assessment first to determine whether BMD screening is
      warranted. For men, the USPSTF states evidence is insufficient for
      universal screening, though other organizations recommend screening
      men aged 70 and older.

    text: "What is osteosarcopenia?"
    options:
      - text: "A bone disorder caused by excessive protein intake"
        correct: false
      - text: "The co-occurrence of sarcopenia and osteopenia or osteoporosis in the same individual"
        correct: true
      - text: "A condition where bone mineral density is normal but muscle mass is low"
        correct: false
      - text: "Age-related bone loss that occurs independently of muscle status"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Osteosarcopenia is the co-occurrence of sarcopenia (low muscle mass,
      strength, and/or function) and osteopenia or osteoporosis within the
      same individual. It affects approximately 21% of community-dwelling
      older adults and carries compounding risks: 2.46x fracture risk,
      1.66x mortality risk, and 1.62x fall risk. Body composition DEXA
      is uniquely positioned to identify both conditions simultaneously
      through low ALMI and low BMC in a single scan.

  - id: bone-q7
    type: scenario
    text: |
      A 58-year-old postmenopausal woman presents for a body composition
      DEXA scan. Her results show BMC at the 12th percentile and ALMI at
      5.8 kg/m². She reports a family history of hip fracture in her mother
      and takes no medications.

      What is the MOST appropriate recommendation?
    options:
      - text: "No action needed — her BMC is above the 10th percentile"
        correct: false
      - text: "Start calcium and vitamin D supplementation only"
        correct: false
      - text: "Refer for clinical BMD testing given her postmenopausal status, borderline BMC, and family history of hip fracture"
        correct: true
      - text: "Diagnose osteoporosis based on the low BMC percentile"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Multiple risk factors converge here: postmenopausal status, borderline
      low BMC (12th percentile), family history of hip fracture (a FRAX
      risk factor), and borderline lean mass. While BMC is above the 10th
      percentile threshold, the combination of risk factors makes clinical
      BMD referral appropriate. This exemplifies body composition DEXA as
      opportunistic screening—the bone data combined with clinical context
      identifies a patient who needs formal evaluation. Only clinical BMD
      can diagnose osteoporosis.

    type: multiple_choice
    text: "Why is body composition DEXA clinically useful for bone health if it cannot diagnose osteoporosis?"
    options:
      - text: "It provides T-scores that are close enough for clinical decisions"
        correct: false
      - text: "It replaces the need for clinical BMD testing in most patients"
        correct: false
      - text: "It serves as opportunistic screening that identifies patients who may benefit from formal BMD evaluation"
        correct: true
      - text: "It measures bone quality rather than bone quantity"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Body composition DEXA serves as opportunistic screening for bone
      health. It reaches patients who may not otherwise be evaluated—
      individuals getting scans for fitness or body composition goals who
      may not have considered bone health. Low BMC percentile, declining
      BMC trends, or low BMC combined with low lean mass can identify
      patients who need formal clinical BMD referral. Additionally, body
      composition DEXA uniquely captures both muscle and bone status,
      enabling identification of osteosarcopenia risk.
