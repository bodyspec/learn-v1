    text: "What is the widely established VAT area threshold for elevated metabolic risk?"
    options:
      - text: "50 cm²"
        correct: false
      - text: "100 cm²"
        correct: true
      - text: "150 cm²"
        correct: false
      - text: "200 cm²"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      The 100 cm² threshold is widely established in metabolic research as
      the cut-point for elevated metabolic risk. Below 100 cm² is
      considered normal/low risk. From 100-160 cm² is elevated (moderate
      risk requiring lifestyle intervention), above 160 cm² is high risk
      (structured intervention indicated), and above 200 cm² is severely
      elevated (comprehensive medical evaluation warranted). These
      thresholds are derived from CT-validated research correlating VAT
      area with metabolic outcomes.

      A 45-year-old man has a BMI of 23.5 (normal weight) but his DEXA
      shows a VAT area of 135 cm². His fasting glucose is 108 mg/dL and
      triglycerides are 185 mg/dL.

      What is the clinical significance of these findings?
    options:
      - text: "His normal BMI means his metabolic risk is low despite the lab values"
        correct: false
      - text: "He represents the TOFI phenotype — normal weight but elevated visceral fat with metabolic abnormalities"
        correct: true
      - text: "The DEXA VAT measurement is likely inaccurate given his normal BMI"
        correct: false
      - text: "His lab values are unrelated to his visceral fat level"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      This patient is a classic example of the TOFI (Thin Outside, Fat
      Inside) phenotype — normal BMI with elevated visceral fat and
      metabolic abnormalities. VAT can vary 3-5 fold among individuals
      with the same BMI. His elevated fasting glucose and triglycerides
      are likely driven by the portal drainage of free fatty acids from
      visceral fat, which impairs hepatic insulin clearance. This is
      precisely why DEXA-based VAT measurement adds clinical value that
      BMI alone cannot provide.

    text: "What makes visceral fat more metabolically dangerous than subcutaneous fat?"
    options:
      - text: "Visceral fat is harder to lose through exercise"
        correct: false
      - text: "Visceral fat releases free fatty acids directly into the portal vein and produces more inflammatory cytokines"
        correct: true
      - text: "Visceral fat contains more fat cells per gram of tissue"
        correct: false
      - text: "Visceral fat is found only in individuals with obesity"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Visceral fat's anatomical position is the key to its metabolic
      danger. It drains free fatty acids directly into the portal vein,
      which carries blood straight to the liver — the "portal hypothesis."
      This impairs hepatic insulin clearance, increases VLDL production,
      and contributes to fatty liver disease. Additionally, VAT produces
      more pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, CRP) and less
      protective adiponectin than subcutaneous fat, creating chronic
      inflammation that drives insulin resistance and atherosclerosis.

      A 53-year-old woman's DEXA shows a VAT area of 210 cm². She has a
      family history of type 2 diabetes and her fasting glucose is 118
      mg/dL. She is otherwise physically active and eats a balanced diet.

      What is the MOST appropriate clinical response?
    options:
      - text: "Reassure her that her active lifestyle is protective despite the VAT level"
        correct: false
      - text: "Recommend she increase her exercise to 5 days per week"
        correct: false
      - text: "Classify as severely elevated VAT, recommend comprehensive medical evaluation alongside structured lifestyle intervention"
        correct: true
      - text: "Repeat the DEXA in 6 months before taking any action"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      A VAT area above 200 cm² is classified as severely elevated,
      warranting comprehensive medical evaluation. Combined with impaired
      fasting glucose (118 mg/dL) and family history of type 2 diabetes,
      this patient has significant metabolic risk. A comprehensive
      approach should include medical evaluation (metabolic panel, HbA1c,
      lipid panel), structured exercise prescription emphasizing aerobic
      exercise for VAT reduction, dietary assessment targeting specific
      VAT-reducing strategies, and follow-up DEXA to track response.

    text: "What is the recommended minimum DEXA scan interval for tracking VAT changes during intervention?"
    options:
      - text: "Monthly"
        correct: false
      - text: "3-6 months"
        correct: true
      - text: "12 months"
        correct: false
      - text: "2 years"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      DEXA scans for VAT monitoring should be spaced 3-6 months apart for
      most interventions. DEXA VAT precision has a coefficient of variation
      of 2-4%, and changes greater than 10% likely represent true change.
      Very early changes (first 4-8 weeks) may reflect fluid shifts and
      glycogen changes rather than true fat loss. Allow at least 12 weeks
      for reliable assessment of fat depot changes. Initial rapid response
      is common in the first 3-4 months, with rates typically slowing as
      levels approach normal ranges.

    text: "Which non-pharmacological intervention approach produces the greatest VAT reduction?"
    options:
      - text: "Resistance training alone"
        correct: false
      - text: "A low-carbohydrate diet"
        correct: false
      - text: "Combined aerobic exercise plus dietary modification"
        correct: true
      - text: "Intermittent fasting"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Combined diet and exercise produces the greatest non-pharmacological
      VAT reduction — approximately 15-25% over 3 months. Among single
      interventions, aerobic exercise (10-20% reduction) is most effective.
      Resistance training alone produces 5-10% reduction but offers
      additional lean mass benefits. GLP-1 medications with lifestyle
      changes can achieve 20-35% reduction at 6 months, but for non-
      pharmacological intervention, the combined aerobic-plus-diet approach
      is most effective. Dietary patterns alone produce 10-20% reduction.

      A patient's serial DEXA scans show that over 6 months of a caloric
      deficit, her total body weight decreased by 4 kg but her VAT area
      increased from 120 cm² to 138 cm². Her lean mass decreased by 3 kg
      while fat mass decreased by 1 kg.

      What is the MOST appropriate response?
    options:
      - text: "The VAT increase is within measurement variability and can be ignored"
        correct: false
      - text: "Encourage her to continue the current plan since she is losing weight"
        correct: false
      - text: "Investigate for underlying causes — VAT increasing during weight loss with disproportionate lean mass loss is a concerning pattern"
        correct: true
      - text: "Recommend switching from caloric restriction to intermittent fasting"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      VAT increasing while total weight decreases is an unusual and
      concerning pattern. Combined with disproportionate lean mass loss
      (3 kg lean vs. 1 kg fat), this suggests an unfavorable metabolic
      trajectory. Possible causes include hormonal dysfunction, Cushing's
      syndrome, medication effects, or severe stress/sleep deprivation.
      This pattern warrants medical evaluation rather than simple dietary
      modification. The body is losing muscle while accumulating visceral
      fat — the opposite of the desired outcome.

    text: "Why does visceral fat typically respond preferentially during early weight loss?"
    options:
      - text: "Because visceral fat cells are larger and easier to mobilize"
        correct: false
      - text: "Because visceral fat has higher lipolytic activity and is more metabolically responsive to caloric deficit and exercise"
        correct: true
      - text: "Because the body prioritizes losing internal fat for organ protection"
        correct: false
      - text: "Because DEXA scanners are more sensitive to visceral fat changes"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Visceral fat has higher lipolytic (fat-breakdown) activity than
      subcutaneous fat, making it more metabolically responsive to caloric
      deficit and exercise interventions. This higher turnover rate means
      VAT is generally the first fat depot to shrink during weight loss.
      This is favorable for metabolic health because even modest lifestyle
      changes can produce meaningful VAT reductions and improve metabolic
      risk markers—often before significant changes in total body weight
      or subcutaneous fat are visible.
