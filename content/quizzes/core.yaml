    text: "What type of model does DEXA use to measure body composition?"
    options:
      - text: "Two-compartment model"
        correct: false
      - text: "Three-compartment model"
        correct: true
      - text: "Four-compartment model"
        correct: false
      - text: "Single-compartment model"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      DEXA uses a three-compartment model, distinguishing between:
      1. Bone mineral content
      2. Lean soft tissue
      3. Fat tissue

      This provides more accurate measurements than two-compartment models
      used by BIA devices.

    text: |
      A patient's BIA scale at home shows 22% body fat, but their DEXA
      scan shows 28%. They ask why the results are so different.

      What is the BEST explanation?
    options:
      - text: "The DEXA machine likely needs recalibration"
        correct: false
      - text: "BIA is highly sensitive to hydration status and uses a less accurate two-compartment model"
        correct: true
      - text: "The patient likely gained fat between the two measurements"
        correct: false
      - text: "Both methods are equally accurate; this variation is normal"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      BIA (bioelectrical impedance analysis) measurements are significantly
      affected by hydration status, meal timing, and exercise. Additionally,
      BIA uses a simpler two-compartment model that cannot distinguish
      bone from lean tissue.

      DEXA provides more consistent, validated measurements with tighter
      precision bounds. A 5-8% difference between BIA and DEXA is common.

    text: "Which of the following is NOT directly measured by a DEXA scan?"
    options:
      - text: "Bone mineral density"
        correct: false
      - text: "Visceral adipose tissue"
        correct: false
      - text: "Muscle fiber composition"
        correct: true
      - text: "Regional fat distribution"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      DEXA measures tissue density and can differentiate between bone,
      lean mass, and fat mass. It can estimate visceral fat from android
      region measurements. However, it cannot determine muscle fiber
      type composition (slow-twitch vs fast-twitch) - that requires
      a muscle biopsy.

    text: "What is the typical precision (coefficient of variation) for DEXA body fat percentage measurements?"
    options:
      - text: "5-10%"
        correct: false
      - text: "1-2%"
        correct: true
      - text: "0.1-0.5%"
        correct: false
      - text: "10-15%"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      DEXA body fat percentage measurements have a precision of approximately
      1-2% CV. This means repeat scans of the same person would typically
      show results within this range. This is significantly more precise
      than consumer methods like BIA scales.

    text: "Why is visceral adipose tissue (VAT) clinically important?"
    options:
      - text: "It is the most visible form of body fat"
        correct: false
      - text: "It is metabolically active and associated with increased disease risk"
        correct: true
      - text: "It is the easiest fat to lose through exercise"
        correct: false
      - text: "It provides essential protection for organs"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Visceral fat is metabolically active and produces inflammatory compounds.
      High VAT is independently associated with cardiovascular disease, type 2
      diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and certain cancers. This makes it one of
      the most important indicators of metabolic health risk.

      A client weighs the same as they did 3 months ago but their DEXA shows
      they lost 5 lbs of fat and gained 5 lbs of lean mass.

      What is this phenomenon called?
    options:
      - text: "Measurement error"
        correct: false
      - text: "Body recomposition"
        correct: true
      - text: "Water retention"
        correct: false
      - text: "Metabolic adaptation"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Body recomposition is the simultaneous loss of fat and gain of muscle.
      Because fat was replaced with muscle of equal weight, the scale shows
      no change while the body composition improved significantly. This is
      why tracking body composition is more informative than tracking weight alone.

    text: "What does an Android-to-Gynoid (A/G) ratio greater than 1.0 indicate?"
    options:
      - text: "More fat is stored in the hip and thigh region"
        correct: false
      - text: "More fat is stored in the abdominal region, indicating higher metabolic risk"
        correct: true
      - text: "Equal distribution of fat between android and gynoid regions"
        correct: false
      - text: "Normal healthy fat distribution for most adults"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      An A/G ratio above 1.0 indicates that more fat is proportionally stored
      in the android (abdominal) region compared to the gynoid (hip/thigh) region.
      This "apple-shaped" distribution is associated with higher metabolic risk
      compared to "pear-shaped" distribution.

    text: "Which factor has the LEAST impact on DEXA measurement accuracy?"
    options:
      - text: "Hydration status"
        correct: false
      - text: "Recent exercise"
        correct: false
      - text: "Clothing color"
        correct: true
      - text: "Time of day"
        correct: false
    explanation: |
      Clothing color has no impact on DEXA measurements. However, hydration
      status, recent exercise, and time of day can all affect results through
      fluid distribution changes. For best consistency, scans should be done
      under similar conditions each time.
