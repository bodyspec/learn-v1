# Key Metrics Explained

A DEXA scan produces numerous metrics that together paint a comprehensive picture of body composition. Understanding what each measurement represents—and its clinical significance—is essential for meaningful interpretation. This section walks through each key metric, explains why it matters, and provides reference ranges to contextualize individual results.

## Primary Composition Metrics

### Body Fat Percentage

Body fat percentage represents the proportion of total body weight that consists of fat tissue. It is the single most recognized body composition metric and provides context that total weight alone cannot: two people at the same weight can have vastly different body compositions, with very different implications for health and performance.

The reference ranges below are derived from **616,000 DEXA scans** in the BodySpec database (347,000 male, 269,000 female) as of February 2026. Unlike traditional body fat categories—which were based on skinfold measurements and other indirect methods—these ranges reflect actual DEXA-measured body fat percentages. Each category corresponds to a percentile band: for example, "Athletic" means leaner than 85% of the scanned population, while "Average" spans the middle 35% of the distribution.

![Body fat percentage ranges for women based on BodySpec DEXA data](/content/assets/diagrams/body-fat-ranges-female.png)

| Category | Percentile Band | Men (DEXA) | Women (DEXA) |
|----------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Essential fat | <1st percentile | Below 9% | Below 14% |
| Athletic | 1st–15th | 9–16% | 14–24% |
| Fitness | 15th–40th | 16–21% | 24–30% |
| Average | 40th–75th | 21–29% | 30–38% |
| Above Average | 75th–90th | 29–34% | 38–43% |
| Obese | >90th | 34%+ | 43%+ |

These ranges serve as general guidelines rather than rigid cutoffs. Because they are based on percentile distributions, they describe where an individual falls relative to the broader DEXA-scanned population. Individual context—including age, activity level, and health goals—should inform how a given body fat percentage is interpreted[^1].

Women naturally carry more essential fat due to reproductive functions. This is biological, not a sign of poor health.

### Lean Body Mass (LBM)

Lean body mass encompasses everything in the body that is not fat: muscle, bone, organs, water, and connective tissue. It is strongly correlated with metabolic rate, functional capacity, and long-term health outcomes. Higher lean mass supports a faster resting metabolism, greater physical strength, and improved resilience to illness and injury. Preserving lean mass during weight loss is particularly critical, as indiscriminate weight reduction that sacrifices muscle can undermine metabolic health and physical function.

### Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI)

FFMI is a height-normalized measure of lean mass, calculated as lean mass in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (FFMI = Lean Mass (kg) / Height (m)²). It functions similarly to BMI but specifically characterizes the lean tissue compartment, making it useful for assessing muscularity independent of body size.

For men, average FFMI values fall around 18 to 19, with values above 22 indicating above-average muscularity and elite athletes typically reaching 24 to 25 or higher. For women, average values are approximately 15 to 16, with values above 18 reflecting above-average muscularity and elite athletes reaching 20 to 21 or higher.

FFMI can help identify sarcopenia risk and assess whether someone is "overfat" despite normal BMI.

## Regional Metrics

DEXA's ability to measure body composition in specific body regions is one of its most valuable capabilities. Regional analysis reveals how fat and lean mass are distributed across the body, which has significant implications for metabolic risk and functional assessment.

### Android Fat (Belly Region)

Android fat refers to fat stored in the abdominal region, measured in the area between the ribs and the top of the pelvis. This region is of particular clinical interest because android fat distribution is associated with higher metabolic risk, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. The proximity of android fat to the portal circulation—the blood supply that feeds directly into the liver—means that excess fat in this region has an outsized impact on metabolic health relative to fat stored elsewhere in the body.

### Gynoid Fat (Hip/Thigh Region)

Gynoid fat is stored in the hip and thigh region and is generally considered more metabolically benign than android fat. Research suggests that gynoid fat may even have protective metabolic effects, acting as a safe storage site for excess energy that keeps lipids out of more harmful locations. The contrast between android and gynoid fat underscores why fat distribution matters as much as—or more than—total fat mass.

### A/G Ratio (Android-to-Gynoid Ratio)

The A/G ratio compares android to gynoid fat percentages and serves as a concise indicator of fat distribution pattern. A ratio below 1.0 indicates a gynoid-predominant pattern associated with lower metabolic risk, while a ratio above 1.0 indicates an android-predominant pattern associated with higher metabolic risk. Men typically have higher A/G ratios than women, reflecting sex-based differences in fat storage patterns. Tracking the A/G ratio over time can reveal shifts in fat distribution that may not be apparent from changes in total body fat alone.

## Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT)

Visceral adipose tissue is fat stored deep within the abdominal cavity, surrounding the internal organs. Often called visceral fat or organ fat, VAT occupies a distinct anatomical position that gives it unique metabolic significance compared to subcutaneous fat (the fat beneath the skin).

![Visceral vs subcutaneous fat locations](/content/assets/diagrams/vat-sat-location.png)

### Why VAT Matters

Visceral fat is metabolically active tissue that produces inflammatory compounds and releases free fatty acids directly into the portal circulation. Elevated VAT is independently associated with cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and certain cancers—risks that persist even after accounting for total body fat and BMI (Neeland et al., 2019)[^2]. This makes VAT one of the most clinically meaningful metrics on a DEXA report.

### VAT Measurements

DEXA reports express visceral fat in three complementary ways. **VAT mass** is the total estimated visceral fat in grams, providing an absolute measure of the visceral fat burden. **VAT volume** expresses the same measurement as a volume in cubic centimeters. **VAT area** estimates the cross-sectional area at the L4-L5 vertebral level in square centimeters, which is directly comparable to CT-based measurements used in research to establish disease risk thresholds.

:::warning
VAT can be elevated even in individuals with normal BMI or body fat percentage—so-called "thin outside, fat inside" (TOFI) phenotype.

### VAT Thresholds

Clinical risk thresholds for VAT area help categorize metabolic risk based on the amount of visceral fat present. These thresholds are derived from research correlating CT-measured VAT with metabolic outcomes.

![VAT risk threshold zones](/content/assets/diagrams/vat-risk-zones.png)

| Risk Level | VAT Area |
|------------|----------|
| Low | <100 cm² |
| Moderate | 100-160 cm² |
| High | >160 cm² |

The 100 cm² threshold is widely established in clinical research as the point above which metabolic risk increases meaningfully (Kaul et al., 2012; Bennett et al., 2024)[^3][^4]. Individual risk depends on the full clinical picture, including age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities.

## Bone Metrics

### Bone Mineral Content (BMC)

Bone mineral content represents the total grams of mineral in the skeleton. While not a primary focus of body composition scans, BMC provides a general indication of skeletal health and can flag significant departures from expected values that warrant further investigation.

### Bone Mineral Density (BMD)

Bone mineral density measures mineral content per unit area (g/cm²) and is the standard metric for assessing osteoporosis risk. BMD values from a full-body DEXA scan provide useful general information about skeletal health, though they serve a different purpose than dedicated diagnostic BMD assessments.

:::note
BodySpec full-body scans provide general BMD information but are not diagnostic for osteoporosis. Clinical BMD testing focuses specifically on the hip and spine using different protocols.

## Using Metrics Together

No single metric tells the complete story of body composition. The most meaningful interpretation emerges from considering multiple metrics in context: body fat percentage for overall composition, lean mass for metabolic and functional health, VAT for metabolic risk, the A/G ratio for fat distribution pattern, and regional data for symmetry and specific concerns. Each metric illuminates a different dimension of health, and together they provide a far more nuanced picture than any one measurement alone.

Perhaps most importantly, changes over time are often more valuable than any single snapshot measurement. A trending decline in lean mass, a rising A/G ratio, or a dropping VAT level tells a story about health trajectory that a single scan cannot.
