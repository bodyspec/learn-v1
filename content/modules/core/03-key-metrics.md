# Key Metrics Explained

A DEXA scan produces numerous metrics. Understanding what each measurement represents—and its clinical significance—is essential for meaningful interpretation.

## Primary Composition Metrics

### Body Fat Percentage
The percentage of total body weight that is fat tissue.

**Why it matters:** Body fat percentage provides context that total weight cannot. Two people at the same weight can have vastly different body compositions.

**Healthy ranges:**

![Body fat percentage ranges for women](/content/assets/diagrams/body-fat-ranges-female.svg)

| Category | Men | Women |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Essential fat | 2-5% | 10-13% |
| Athletes | 6-13% | 14-20% |
| Fitness | 14-17% | 21-24% |
| Average | 18-24% | 25-31% |
| Obese | 25%+ | 32%+ |

:::note
Women naturally carry more essential fat due to reproductive functions. This is biological, not a sign of poor health.

### Lean Body Mass (LBM)
Everything that isn't fat: muscle, bone, organs, water, and connective tissue.

**Why it matters:** Lean mass is strongly correlated with metabolic rate, functional capacity, and long-term health outcomes. Preserving lean mass during weight loss is critical.

### Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI)
A height-normalized measure of lean mass, similar to BMI but for muscle.

**Formula:** FFMI = Lean Mass (kg) / Height (m)²

**Interpretation:**
- Men: Average ~18-19, muscular >22, elite athletes 24-25+
- Women: Average ~15-16, muscular >18, elite athletes 20-21+

:::clinical
FFMI can help identify sarcopenia risk and assess whether someone is "overfat" despite normal BMI.

## Regional Metrics

### Android Fat (Belly Region)
Fat stored in the abdominal region, measured between the ribs and top of the pelvis.

**Why it matters:** Android fat distribution is associated with higher metabolic risk, including:
- Insulin resistance
- Cardiovascular disease
- Type 2 diabetes

### Gynoid Fat (Hip/Thigh Region)
Fat stored in the hip and thigh region.

**Why it matters:** Gynoid fat is generally considered more metabolically benign than android fat.

### A/G Ratio (Android-to-Gynoid Ratio)
The ratio of android to gynoid fat percentages.

**Interpretation:**
- <1.0: Lower metabolic risk
- >1.0: Higher metabolic risk
- Men typically have higher A/G ratios than women

## Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT)

![Visceral vs subcutaneous fat locations](/content/assets/diagrams/vat-sat-location.svg)

### What is VAT?
Fat stored deep in the abdominal cavity, surrounding the organs. Also called "visceral fat" or "organ fat."

### Why VAT Matters
Visceral fat is metabolically active and produces inflammatory compounds. High VAT is independently associated with[^2]:
- Cardiovascular disease
- Type 2 diabetes
- Metabolic syndrome
- Certain cancers

### VAT Measurements

**VAT Mass:** Total grams of visceral fat

**VAT Volume:** Volume in cm³

**VAT Area:** Cross-sectional area at L4-L5 vertebrae (comparable to CT measurements)

:::warning
VAT can be elevated even in individuals with normal BMI or body fat percentage—so-called "thin outside, fat inside" (TOFI) phenotype.
:::

### VAT Thresholds

![VAT risk threshold zones](/content/assets/diagrams/vat-risk-zones.svg)

| Risk Level | VAT Area |
|------------|----------|
| Low | <100 cm² |
| Moderate | 100-160 cm² |
| High | >160 cm² |

*The 100 cm² threshold is widely used in clinical research as a cut-point for elevated metabolic risk.*[^3][^4]

## Bone Metrics

### Bone Mineral Content (BMC)
Total grams of mineral in the skeleton.

### Bone Mineral Density (BMD)
Mineral density per area (g/cm²). Used to assess osteoporosis risk.

:::note
BodySpec full-body scans provide general BMD information but are not diagnostic for osteoporosis. Clinical BMD testing focuses specifically on the hip and spine using different protocols.
:::

## Using Metrics Together

No single metric tells the complete story. The most meaningful interpretation considers:

1. **Body fat %** for overall composition
2. **Lean mass** for metabolic and functional health
3. **VAT** for metabolic risk
4. **A/G ratio** for fat distribution pattern
5. **Regional data** for symmetry and specific concerns

Changes over time are often more valuable than any single snapshot measurement.
