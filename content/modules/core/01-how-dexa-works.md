# How DEXA Works

DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) is the gold standard for measuring body composition. Originally developed for bone density assessment, DEXA technology has evolved to provide highly accurate measurements of fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral content.

## The Technology

DEXA scanners emit two low-energy X-ray beams at different energy levels. As these beams pass through the body, different tissues absorb them at different rates:

- **Bone** absorbs the most energy (appears brightest)
- **Lean tissue** absorbs moderate energy
- **Fat tissue** absorbs the least energy (appears darkest)

The scanner's detectors measure how much of each beam passes through, allowing the software to calculate the composition of tissue at every point along the scan.

:::note
The radiation exposure from a DEXA scan is extremely low—about 1/10th of a chest X-ray, or roughly equivalent to a few hours of natural background radiation.

## Three-Compartment Model

DEXA uses a three-compartment model, which distinguishes between:

1. **Bone mineral content (BMC)** - The mineral portion of your bones
2. **Fat mass** - All adipose tissue in the body
3. **Lean soft tissue** - Muscle, organs, water, and everything else that isn't bone or fat

This is more accurate than two-compartment models (like BIA scales) that only distinguish between fat and fat-free mass.

## The Scanning Process

During a BodySpec scan:

1. You lie still on a padded table
2. The scanner arm passes over your body from head to toe
3. The scan takes approximately 6-7 minutes
4. Software processes the data to create a detailed body composition report

## Regional Analysis

One of DEXA's key advantages is its ability to provide **regional analysis**. The scan divides the body into segments:

- Arms (left and right separately)
- Legs (left and right separately)
- Trunk (further divided into android and gynoid regions)

This allows for identification of asymmetries and specific areas of concern.

Regional analysis is particularly valuable for detecting muscle imbalances that may increase injury risk, or for tracking recovery after injury or surgery.

## What DEXA Cannot Measure

While DEXA is highly accurate for body composition, it has limitations:

- Cannot distinguish between intramuscular fat and muscle tissue
- Cannot determine muscle fiber type
- Cannot directly measure hydration status
- Cannot assess muscle quality or function

Understanding these limitations helps set appropriate expectations for what insights a DEXA scan can provide.
