# Accuracy & Validity

Understanding DEXA's accuracy is essential for properly interpreting results and counseling patients or clients. DEXA is considered the clinical gold standard for body composition assessment, but like all measurement methods, it has precision bounds.

## Precision vs. Accuracy

**Precision** (reproducibility) refers to how consistently the same result is obtained when measuring the same person multiple times.

**Accuracy** refers to how close the measurement is to the true value.

DEXA excels in both areas when proper protocols are followed.

## DEXA Precision

Under controlled conditions, DEXA shows excellent precision[^1][^2]:

| Measurement | Precision (CV%) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Total body fat % | 1-2% |
| Lean mass | 0.5-1% |
| Bone mineral density | 1-1.5% |
| Visceral fat | 2-4% |

:::note
CV% (coefficient of variation) represents the typical measurement variation. A 1% CV on a body fat measurement of 20% means repeat scans would typically range from 19.8% to 20.2%.

## Factors Affecting Accuracy

Several factors can influence DEXA measurements:

### Hydration Status
- Overhydration can slightly underestimate body fat %
- Dehydration can slightly overestimate body fat %
- Effect is typically small (1-2%) under normal conditions

### Food and Fluid Intake
- Recent meals add weight that may be misclassified
- Best practice: scan in a fasted or consistently fed state

### Exercise
- Recent exercise can temporarily shift fluid distribution
- Best practice: avoid intense exercise 24 hours before scanning

### Positioning
- Consistent positioning is critical for accurate comparisons
- BodySpec technicians follow strict positioning protocols

## Comparing Methods

DEXA significantly outperforms consumer-grade methods[^3][^4]:

| Method | Typical Error |
|--------|--------------|
| DEXA | ±1-2% |
| BIA Scales | ±4-8% |
| Skinfold Calipers | ±3-5% |
| Visual Estimation | ±8-15% |

:::warning
BIA (bioelectrical impedance) measurements from home scales can vary by 5% or more based on hydration, meal timing, and time of day. These fluctuations often exceed actual body composition changes.

## Validation Studies

DEXA has been validated against[^1][^5]:

- **4-compartment models** (the most accurate research method)
- **MRI** for regional fat distribution
- **CT scanning** for visceral fat assessment

These studies consistently show DEXA provides clinically accurate measurements that correlate highly with gold-standard research methods. For example, DXA-derived visceral fat measurements correlate with CT at r² > 0.95[^5].

## Best Practices for Accurate Scans

To maximize measurement consistency:

1. Scan at the same time of day
2. Maintain similar hydration and meal status
3. Wear minimal, consistent clothing
4. Avoid intense exercise 24 hours prior
5. Use the same scanner when possible

:::tip
For tracking changes over time, consistency in scan conditions is more important than achieving "perfect" conditions. The key is comparing apples to apples.
