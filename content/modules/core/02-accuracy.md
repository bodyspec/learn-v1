# Accuracy & Validity

Understanding DEXA's accuracy is essential for properly interpreting results and counseling patients or clients. DEXA is considered the clinical gold standard for body composition assessment, but like all measurement methods, it has precision bounds.

## Precision vs. Accuracy

Two distinct concepts define measurement quality. Precision, also called reproducibility, refers to how consistently the same result is obtained when measuring the same person multiple times—a highly precise method produces nearly identical numbers on repeat measurements. Accuracy refers to how close the measurement is to the true value—an accurate method captures what is actually there. DEXA excels in both areas when proper protocols are followed.

## DEXA Precision

Under controlled conditions, DEXA demonstrates excellent precision across all major measurements. The following table summarizes the coefficient of variation (CV%) for each metric, reflecting the typical measurement variation observed in repeated scans of the same individual (Shepherd et al., 2017; Toombs et al., 2012)[^1][^2].

| Measurement | Precision (CV%) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Total body fat % | 1-2% |
| Lean mass | 0.5-1% |
| Bone mineral density | 1-1.5% |
| Visceral fat | 2-4% |

:::note
CV% (coefficient of variation) represents the typical measurement variation. A 1% CV on a body fat measurement of 20% means repeat scans would typically range from 19.8% to 20.2%.

## Factors Affecting Accuracy

Several factors can influence DEXA measurements:

### Hydration Status

Hydration is the single largest modifiable factor affecting DEXA accuracy. Overhydration can slightly underestimate body fat percentage because excess water is classified as lean tissue, while dehydration can slightly overestimate body fat percentage for the inverse reason. Under normal hydration conditions, this effect is typically small—on the order of 1 to 2 percent.

### Food and Fluid Intake

Recent meals add mass that the scanner must account for, and food in the digestive tract may be misclassified between tissue compartments. Scanning in a fasted state or a consistently fed state across visits minimizes this source of variability.

### Exercise

Recent exercise can temporarily shift fluid distribution between compartments—plasma volume changes, fluid moves into exercised muscles, and sweat losses alter hydration status. Avoiding intense exercise for 24 hours before scanning eliminates this confound.

### Positioning

Consistent positioning is critical for accurate comparisons between scans, as even small differences in arm or leg placement can shift how tissue is assigned to regional compartments. BodySpec technicians follow strict standardized positioning protocols to ensure scan-to-scan comparability.

## Comparing Methods

DEXA significantly outperforms consumer-grade body composition methods in both accuracy and reliability. The following comparison illustrates the typical error range for each method (Malavolti et al., 2003; Achamrah et al., 2018)[^3][^4].

| Method | Typical Error |
|--------|--------------|
| DEXA | ±1-2% |
| BIA Scales | ±4-8% |
| Skinfold Calipers | ±3-5% |
| Visual Estimation | ±8-15% |

:::warning
BIA (bioelectrical impedance) measurements from home scales can vary by 5% or more based on hydration, meal timing, and time of day. These fluctuations often exceed actual body composition changes.

## Validation Studies

DEXA has been validated against the most rigorous research-grade methods available. Four-compartment models, considered the most accurate approach for measuring body composition, confirm DEXA's accuracy for total body fat and lean mass. MRI validation studies demonstrate strong agreement for regional fat distribution measurements. CT scanning comparisons validate DEXA's visceral fat estimates, with DXA-derived visceral fat measurements correlating with CT at r² > 0.95 (Shepherd et al., 2017; Kaul et al., 2012)[^1][^5]. These studies consistently show that DEXA provides clinically accurate measurements suitable for both individual assessment and longitudinal tracking.

## Best Practices for Accurate Scans

Maximizing measurement consistency requires attention to a few straightforward practices. Scanning at the same time of day controls for diurnal variations in hydration and body weight. Maintaining similar hydration and meal status across visits eliminates the largest controllable sources of variability. Wearing minimal, consistent clothing ensures that external mass does not confound the measurement. Avoiding intense exercise for 24 hours prior prevents exercise-induced fluid shifts from affecting results. Using the same scanner when possible eliminates inter-machine variability from the comparison.

:::tip
For tracking changes over time, consistency in scan conditions is more important than achieving "perfect" conditions. The key is comparing apples to apples.
