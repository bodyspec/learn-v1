# Reading a BodySpec Report

BodySpec reports are designed to present complex body composition data in an accessible, interactive format. Unlike traditional DEXA reports—which are typically static PDF printouts with tables of numbers—BodySpec delivers results through an [interactive web dashboard](https://www.bodyspec.com/sample-report) that makes it easier for both providers and clients to understand the data and track progress over time. This section walks through each component of the report.

## Report Overview

![BodySpec report anatomy](/content/assets/diagrams/report-anatomy.png)

A BodySpec report includes:

1. Summary dashboard with key metrics and visual indicators
2. Detailed body composition breakdown
3. Regional analysis with symmetry data
4. Visceral fat assessment with percentile ranking
5. Trend charts and historical comparisons (for repeat scans)
6. Percentile rankings drawn from a dataset of over 450,000 scans

## Summary Dashboard

The summary dashboard provides at-a-glance key metrics:

- **Total Weight** — Your weight at the time of scan
- **Body Fat %** — Percentage of weight from fat, with color-coded health range indicator
- **Lean Mass** — Weight of non-fat, non-bone tissue
- **Fat Mass** — Weight of fat tissue
- **Bone Mass** — Weight of bone mineral

:::tip
Focus on body fat % and lean mass rather than total weight. The goal is usually to increase or maintain lean mass while reducing fat mass. BodySpec's dashboard highlights these metrics prominently to help shift focus away from scale weight.

## Body Composition Breakdown

This section shows the precise weights of each tissue type:

| Tissue | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Fat | XX.X lbs |
| Lean | XX.X lbs |
| Bone | X.X lbs |
| **Total** | **XXX.X lbs** |

The report includes visual breakdowns showing the proportion of each tissue type, making it immediately clear how body weight is distributed across compartments.

## Regional Analysis

The regional breakdown divides the body into:

- **Arms** (left and right)
- **Legs** (left and right)
- **Trunk**
- **Android region** (belly)
- **Gynoid region** (hips/thighs)

For each region, the report displays:
- Fat mass (grams or pounds)
- Lean mass (grams or pounds)
- Body fat % for that region

### Symmetry Analysis

BodySpec reports include a dedicated symmetry view that compares left vs. right limbs, making it straightforward to identify imbalances:

- **Normal variation:** 1-3% difference
- **Notable asymmetry:** >5% difference
- **Significant asymmetry:** >10% difference

This is particularly useful for rehabilitation tracking, identifying compensation patterns, and monitoring unilateral training effects. Traditional DEXA reports often bury this data in tables, making it easy to overlook.

Significant asymmetries may indicate:
- Previous injury or surgical recovery
- Compensation patterns
- Unilateral training effects
- Neurological conditions (in extreme cases)

## Visceral Fat Section

The VAT section provides one of the report's most clinically valuable metrics:

- **VAT Mass** in grams
- **VAT Area** in cm² (comparable to CT measurements)
- **Risk category** based on established clinical thresholds
- **Percentile ranking** showing where you fall relative to others of the same age and sex

BodySpec's VAT percentile ranking draws on a reference dataset of over 450,000 scans, providing more granular context than the threshold categories alone. A patient may fall in the "moderate" risk range but be at the 85th percentile for their age group—a more actionable insight for clinical conversations.

### Interpreting VAT Results

| VAT Area | Risk Category | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| <100 cm² | Low | Maintain current habits |
| 100-160 cm² | Moderate | Consider lifestyle modifications |
| >160 cm² | High | Recommend intervention |

## Trend Tracking

For clients with multiple scans, BodySpec's trend tracking is one of the report's most powerful features. The dashboard overlays historical data so changes are immediately visible:

- Body fat % over time
- Lean mass over time
- Fat mass over time
- VAT changes over time
- Regional changes

Because BodySpec stores scan history digitally, clients can track their composition across dozens of scans over years—far beyond the two-scan comparisons typically available from traditional DEXA providers.

### Reading Trend Data

Look for:
- **Direction:** Is the trend moving in the desired direction?
- **Magnitude:** Are changes clinically significant (beyond measurement precision)?
- **Consistency:** Is the trend stable or erratic?

:::note
Short-term fluctuations (1-2%) may be within measurement precision. Focus on trends over 3+ measurements or 6+ months.
:::

## Percentile Rankings

BodySpec reports include percentile rankings compared to population norms stratified by age and sex. These rankings draw on BodySpec's dataset of over 450,000 scans, providing robust comparison data.

**Example interpretation:**
- "Your lean mass is at the 75th percentile" means you have more lean mass than 75% of people your age and sex in the reference population.

Percentiles provide context that absolute numbers cannot. Being at the 90th percentile for lean mass is meaningful regardless of the actual weight—and percentiles help clients understand where they stand relative to peers, not just abstract thresholds.

## AI Assistant

BodySpec reports include access to a 24/7 AI assistant that can help interpret results, explain metrics, and answer questions about the report. This is particularly useful for:

- Clients reviewing results on their own after a scan
- Understanding what specific metrics mean for their health
- Getting context on how their results compare to population norms
- Identifying which areas to focus on for improvement

The AI assistant complements—but does not replace—professional guidance from healthcare providers and fitness professionals.

## Common Questions

### Why doesn't my weight match my scale at home?
DEXA weighs you in minimal clothing, lying down, at a specific time. Home scales vary by time of day, clothing, hydration, and meals.

### Why is my body fat higher than expected?
DEXA is more accurate than most consumer methods. BIA scales and gym machines typically underestimate body fat by 5-8%. The DEXA number is closer to reality.

### What's more important—the numbers or the trends?
Both matter, but trends are often more actionable. Small consistent changes in the right direction indicate effective interventions. BodySpec's longitudinal tracking makes trend analysis straightforward.

### How do I access my report?
BodySpec delivers results through a secure web dashboard, accessible on any device. Results are typically available on the same day as your scan—no waiting for a provider to mail a paper report.
