# Reading a BodySpec Report

BodySpec reports are designed to present complex body composition data in an accessible, interactive format. Unlike traditional DEXA reports—which are typically static PDF printouts with tables of numbers—BodySpec delivers results through an [interactive web dashboard](https://www.bodyspec.com/sample-report) that makes it easier for both providers and clients to understand the data and track progress over time. This section walks through each component of the report.

## Report Overview

A BodySpec report is organized into several interconnected components that together provide a complete picture of body composition. The report opens with a summary dashboard displaying key metrics and visual indicators at a glance. Below that, a detailed body composition breakdown quantifies the precise amounts of fat, lean, and bone tissue. Regional analysis with symmetry data reveals how composition varies across different body segments. A dedicated visceral fat assessment includes percentile ranking for metabolic risk context. For clients with multiple scans, trend charts and historical comparisons track progress over time. Throughout the report, percentile rankings drawn from a dataset of over 450,000 scans provide population-level context for individual results.

## Summary Dashboard

The summary dashboard provides the most important metrics at a glance, designed for quick clinical assessment or client review. **Total weight** reflects the client's weight at the time of scan. **Body fat percentage** shows the proportion of weight from fat tissue, with a color-coded health range indicator that provides immediate visual context. **Lean mass** and **fat mass** quantify the weight of non-fat, non-bone tissue and fat tissue respectively. **Bone mass** reports the weight of bone mineral content.

Focus on body fat % and lean mass rather than total weight. The goal is usually to increase or maintain lean mass while reducing fat mass. BodySpec's dashboard highlights body fat percentage, lean mass, and fat mass prominently to help shift focus away from scale weight.

## Body Composition Breakdown

The body composition breakdown section shows the precise weights of each tissue type, providing the raw data behind the summary metrics.

| Tissue | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Fat | XX.X lbs |
| Lean | XX.X lbs |
| Bone | X.X lbs |
| **Total** | **XXX.X lbs** |

The report includes visual breakdowns showing the proportion of each tissue type, making it immediately clear how body weight is distributed across compartments.

## Regional Analysis

One of DEXA's most valuable capabilities is its ability to measure body composition in specific body regions. The regional breakdown divides the body into arms (left and right separately), legs (left and right separately), trunk, the android region (belly), and the gynoid region (hips and thighs). For each region, the report displays fat mass, lean mass, and the body fat percentage specific to that area—providing granular detail that whole-body metrics cannot capture.

### Symmetry Analysis

BodySpec reports include a dedicated symmetry view that compares left versus right limbs, making it straightforward to identify imbalances. Normal biological variation typically produces differences of 1 to 3 percent between sides. Differences greater than 5 percent represent notable asymmetry worth monitoring, while differences exceeding 10 percent are considered significant and may warrant clinical attention.

This symmetry data is particularly useful for rehabilitation tracking, identifying compensation patterns, and monitoring unilateral training effects. Traditional DEXA reports often bury this data in tables, making it easy to overlook.

Significant asymmetries may indicate previous injury or surgical recovery, compensation patterns, unilateral training effects, or in extreme cases, neurological conditions.

## Visceral Fat Section

The VAT section provides one of the report's most clinically valuable metrics. The report displays VAT mass in grams, VAT area in square centimeters (comparable to CT measurements), a risk category based on established clinical thresholds, and a percentile ranking showing where the client falls relative to others of the same age and sex.

BodySpec's VAT percentile ranking draws on a reference dataset of over 450,000 scans, providing context beyond simple threshold categories. For example, a patient may fall in the "moderate" risk range but be at the 85th percentile for their age group—a more actionable insight for clinical conversations than the risk category alone.

### Interpreting VAT Results

The following thresholds guide clinical interpretation of VAT area measurements and inform the appropriate clinical response.

| VAT Area | Risk Category | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| <100 cm² | Low | Maintain current habits |
| 100-160 cm² | Moderate | Consider lifestyle modifications |
| >160 cm² | High | Recommend intervention |

## Trend Tracking

For clients with multiple scans, BodySpec's trend tracking is one of the report's most powerful features. The dashboard overlays historical data so changes in body fat percentage, lean mass, fat mass, VAT, and regional composition are immediately visible across time. Because BodySpec stores scan history digitally, clients can track their composition across dozens of scans over years—far beyond the two-scan comparisons typically available from traditional DEXA providers.

### Reading Trend Data

Effective trend interpretation focuses on three dimensions. **Direction** indicates whether the trend is moving in the desired direction—fat mass declining, lean mass stable or increasing, VAT decreasing. **Magnitude** determines whether changes are clinically significant, exceeding the measurement precision of the scan. **Consistency** reveals whether the trend is stable and progressive or erratic and noisy, which helps distinguish genuine physiological changes from measurement variability.

:::note
Short-term fluctuations (1-2%) may be within measurement precision. Focus on trends over 3+ measurements or 6+ months.

## Percentile Rankings

BodySpec reports include percentile rankings compared to population norms stratified by age and sex. These rankings draw on BodySpec's dataset of over 450,000 scans, providing robust comparison data. For example, "your lean mass is at the 75th percentile" means the client has more lean mass than 75 percent of people their age and sex in the reference population.

Percentiles provide context that absolute numbers cannot. Being at the 90th percentile for lean mass is meaningful regardless of the actual weight—and percentiles help clients understand where they stand relative to peers, not just abstract thresholds.

## AI Assistant

BodySpec reports include access to a 24/7 AI assistant that can help interpret results, explain metrics, and answer questions about the report. This is particularly useful for clients reviewing results on their own after a scan, for understanding what specific metrics mean in the context of their health, for getting context on how their results compare to population norms, and for identifying which areas to focus on for improvement. The AI assistant complements—but does not replace—professional guidance from healthcare providers and fitness professionals.

## Common Questions

### Why doesn't my weight match my scale at home?
DEXA weighs you in minimal clothing, lying down, at a specific time. Home scales vary by time of day, clothing, hydration, and meals.

### Why is my body fat higher than expected?
DEXA is more accurate than most consumer methods. BIA scales and gym machines typically underestimate body fat by 5-8%. The DEXA number is closer to reality.

### What's more important—the numbers or the trends?
Both matter, but trends are often more actionable. Small consistent changes in the right direction indicate effective interventions. BodySpec's longitudinal tracking makes trend analysis straightforward.

### How do I access my report?
BodySpec delivers results through a secure web dashboard, accessible on any device. Results are typically available on the same day as your scan—no waiting for a provider to mail a paper report.
