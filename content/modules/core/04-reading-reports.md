# Reading a BodySpec Report

BodySpec reports are designed to present complex data in an accessible format. This section walks through each component of the report.

## Report Overview

A BodySpec report includes:

1. Summary page with key metrics
2. Body composition breakdown
3. Regional analysis
4. Visceral fat assessment
5. Trend charts (for repeat scans)
6. Comparison to population norms

## Summary Section

The summary provides at-a-glance key metrics:

- **Total Weight** - Your weight at the time of scan
- **Body Fat %** - Percentage of weight from fat
- **Lean Mass** - Weight of non-fat tissue
- **Fat Mass** - Weight of fat tissue
- **Bone Mass** - Weight of bone mineral

:::tip
Focus on body fat % and lean mass rather than total weight. The goal is usually to increase or maintain lean mass while reducing fat mass.

## Body Composition Breakdown

This section shows the precise weights of each tissue type:

| Tissue | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Fat | XX.X lbs |
| Lean | XX.X lbs |
| Bone | X.X lbs |
| **Total** | **XXX.X lbs** |

The visualization often includes a pie chart showing the proportion of each tissue type.

## Regional Analysis

The regional breakdown divides the body into:

- **Arms** (left and right)
- **Legs** (left and right)
- **Trunk**
- **Android region** (belly)
- **Gynoid region** (hips/thighs)

For each region, you'll see:
- Fat mass (grams or pounds)
- Lean mass (grams or pounds)
- Body fat % for that region

### Identifying Asymmetries

Compare left vs. right:
- **Normal variation:** 1-3% difference
- **Notable asymmetry:** >5% difference
- **Significant asymmetry:** >10% difference

:::clinical
Significant asymmetries may indicate:
- Previous injury
- Compensation patterns
- Unilateral training effects
- Neurological conditions (in extreme cases)
:::

## Visceral Fat Section

The VAT section includes:

- **VAT Mass** in grams
- **VAT Area** in cm² (comparable to CT measurements)
- **Risk category** based on thresholds
- Visual comparison to healthy ranges

### Interpreting VAT Results

| VAT Area | Risk Category | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| <100 cm² | Low | Maintain current habits |
| 100-160 cm² | Moderate | Consider lifestyle modifications |
| >160 cm² | High | Recommend intervention |

## Trend Charts

For clients with multiple scans, trend charts show:

- Body fat % over time
- Lean mass over time
- Fat mass over time
- Regional changes

### Reading Trend Data

Look for:
- **Direction:** Is the trend moving in the desired direction?
- **Magnitude:** Are changes clinically significant?
- **Consistency:** Is the trend stable or erratic?

:::note
Short-term fluctuations (1-2%) may be within measurement precision. Focus on trends over 3+ measurements or 6+ months.
:::

## Percentile Rankings

BodySpec reports include percentile rankings compared to population norms by age and sex.

**Example interpretation:**
- "Your lean mass is at the 75th percentile" means you have more lean mass than 75% of people your age and sex.

Percentiles provide context that absolute numbers cannot. Being at the 90th percentile for lean mass is impressive regardless of the actual weight.

## Common Questions

### Why doesn't my weight match my scale at home?
DEXA weighs you in minimal clothing, lying down, at a specific time. Home scales vary by time of day, clothing, hydration, and meals.

### Why is my body fat higher than expected?
DEXA is more accurate than most consumer methods. BIA scales and gym machines typically underestimate body fat.

### What's more important—the numbers or the trends?
Both matter, but trends are often more actionable. Small consistent changes in the right direction indicate effective interventions.
