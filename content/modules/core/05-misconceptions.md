# Misconceptions & FAQs

Body composition is surrounded by myths and misunderstandings. This section addresses the most common misconceptions.

## Common Misconceptions

### "Muscle weighs more than fat"

**Reality:** A pound is a pound. What people mean is that muscle is *denser* than fat—the same volume of muscle weighs more than the same volume of fat.

This is why two people at the same weight can look very different. The person with more muscle mass will typically appear leaner and take up less space.

### "I want to turn fat into muscle"

**Reality:** Fat and muscle are completely different tissues. You cannot convert one to the other. However, you can lose fat through a caloric deficit, build muscle through resistance training and adequate protein, and under certain conditions do both simultaneously—a process known as body recomposition.

:::note
Body recomposition—losing fat while gaining muscle—is most achievable for beginners to resistance training, those returning after a break, or those with higher body fat levels (Barakat et al., 2020)[^2].

### "BMI tells you if you're healthy"

![Same BMI, different body composition](/content/assets/diagrams/dexa-vs-bmi.png)

**Reality:** BMI cannot distinguish between fat and muscle. Someone with significant muscle mass may have a "overweight" BMI while being metabolically healthy. Conversely, someone with normal BMI can have elevated body fat and visceral fat.

Body composition provides the context that BMI lacks.

### "I can spot-reduce fat"

**Reality:** You cannot choose where your body loses fat. Targeted exercises strengthen specific muscles but don't preferentially burn fat in that area.

Fat loss follows genetic patterns. Most people lose visceral fat first (which is good news for health), followed by pattern-dependent subcutaneous fat loss.

### "Low body fat is always better"

**Reality:** Essential fat is required for normal physiological function. Dropping below essential fat levels can cause hormonal disruption, immune suppression, loss of menstruation in women, decreased athletic performance, and increased injury risk. The health benefits of lower body fat follow a U-shaped curve—both very high and very low levels carry significant risks.

:::warning
Athletes pursuing very low body fat should do so under professional supervision and only for limited competition periods.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I get scanned?

For most people, every 3-6 months is appropriate. This allows time for meaningful changes while providing accountability checkpoints.

**More frequent scanning (monthly)** may be appropriate for:
- Athletes in competition prep
- Medical monitoring situations
- Research studies

**Less frequent scanning (annually)** is fine for:
- General health monitoring
- Maintenance phases

### Will my results be different at different times of day?

Yes, minor variations occur due to hydration status, recent meals, bladder and bowel contents, and exercise-induced fluid shifts. For best consistency, scan at the same time of day under similar conditions.

### Why is my DEXA body fat higher than other methods?

DEXA is more accurate than consumer methods. Most BIA scales and handheld devices systematically underestimate body fat. When people first get a DEXA scan, they're often surprised to find their actual body fat is 5-8% higher than their scale indicated.

### Can I compare results from different DEXA machines?

Different manufacturers and even different models can produce slightly different results. For tracking trends, it's best to use the same scanner. However, DEXA results from any calibrated machine are generally comparable and clinically meaningful.

### Does muscle loss show up immediately?

Muscle loss takes time to develop. If you've taken time off from training, initial "losses" may reflect reduced muscle glycogen and associated water (which DEXA counts as lean mass), natural measurement variation, or—after extended periods of inactivity—true muscle atrophy. Distinguishing between these requires serial scans over time.

:::tip
Focus on trends over 3+ months rather than single data points. Short-term fluctuations are normal.

### Can I scan while pregnant?

No. Although DEXA radiation is very low, BodySpec does not scan pregnant women as a precaution. Additionally, pregnancy dramatically changes body composition in ways that make scanning not clinically useful.

### Is DEXA safe?

Yes. A DEXA body composition scan delivers approximately 1-10 microsieverts (μSv) of radiation[^1]—less than a chest X-ray (~20-100 μSv), a coast-to-coast flight (~30-40 μSv), or a day of natural background exposure (~8 μSv). The diagnostic value far exceeds any theoretical risk for most people.

Individuals who have had significant recent radiation exposure, those undergoing radiation therapy, and women who may be pregnant should consult their doctor before scanning.

## Summary

Understanding body composition requires moving beyond simplistic measures like weight and BMI. DEXA provides the detailed, accurate data needed for meaningful health assessment and tracking—but only when properly interpreted with an understanding of its capabilities and limitations.
