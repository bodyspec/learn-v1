# Scan Preparation

Getting consistent, accurate DEXA results starts before you arrive at the scanner. Following a few simple preparation guidelines ensures your scan captures a true snapshot of your body composition and that results are comparable across visits.

## Before Your Scan

### Hydration

Hydration status is the single largest modifiable factor affecting DEXA accuracy[^1]:

- **Drink normally** — don't over-hydrate or restrict fluids
- **Avoid excessive water intake** in the 2 hours before your scan (overhydration can slightly underestimate body fat)
- **Avoid scanning when dehydrated** (illness, post-sauna, after heavy sweating without rehydration)
- **Be consistent** — if you scanned well-hydrated last time, aim for the same this time

:::note
Under normal hydration, the effect on body fat percentage is small (1-2%). Consistency matters more than perfection.

### Food and Drink

Recent meals add mass that the scanner must account for:

- **Best practice:** Scan in a similar fed state each time (either fasted or after a light meal)
- **Avoid large meals** within 2 hours of scanning
- **Avoid alcohol** for 24 hours before scanning (alcohol affects fluid distribution)
- **Caffeine** in normal amounts is fine

### Exercise

Physical activity temporarily shifts fluid between compartments:

- **Avoid intense exercise** for 12-24 hours before scanning
- Light activity (walking, stretching) is fine
- The concern is exercise-induced fluid shifts, not muscle damage

### Timing

- **Scan at a similar time of day** for each visit (body composition metrics fluctuate slightly throughout the day due to food, water, and gravity-related fluid shifts)
- **Morning scans** tend to be most consistent because overnight fasting normalizes hydration

## At Your Scan

### Clothing

- **Wear lightweight, form-fitting clothing** without metal (athletic wear is ideal)
- Remove jewelry, belts, and anything with metal fasteners or zippers
- **Be consistent** — wear similar clothing each visit
- BodySpec provides appropriate scanning attire if needed

### Positioning

Consistent positioning is critical for accurate comparisons between scans:

- Lie still on the padded table in the position the technician directs
- Arms at your sides, palms facing down
- Feet together, slightly turned inward
- BodySpec technicians follow standardized positioning protocols to ensure scan-to-scan comparability

### During the Scan

- Stay still — movement introduces measurement artifacts
- Breathe normally
- The scan takes approximately 6-7 minutes
- The process is painless — you simply lie on a padded table

## Special Considerations

### Menstrual Cycle

Fluid retention during menstruation can affect lean mass readings by 1-2 lbs. For maximum consistency:
- Track where you are in your cycle
- Aim to scan at the same phase each time (if practical)
- Don't stress over this — the effect is small and trends still emerge clearly

### Medications

Some medications affect fluid distribution:
- **Diuretics** can cause dehydration artifacts
- **Corticosteroids** can cause fluid retention
- Don't change your medication routine for a scan — just be consistent

### Recent Travel

Long flights cause fluid shifts (swelling in legs, dehydration). Wait 24-48 hours after significant travel before scanning.

## Consistency Checklist

For the most comparable results across visits:

- [ ] Similar time of day
- [ ] Similar hydration and meal status
- [ ] No intense exercise in the past 12-24 hours
- [ ] Lightweight clothing without metal
- [ ] Same scanner location (when possible)

:::tip
Perfect conditions aren't required for useful data — consistent conditions are. The goal is comparing apples to apples across visits so that real changes in body composition are distinguishable from preparation-related variability.
