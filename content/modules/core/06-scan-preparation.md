# Scan Preparation

Getting consistent, accurate DEXA results starts before you arrive at the scanner. Following a few simple preparation guidelines ensures your scan captures a true snapshot of your body composition and that results are comparable across visits.

## Before Your Scan

### Hydration

Hydration status is the single largest modifiable factor affecting DEXA accuracy (Shepherd et al., 2017)[^1]. The goal is to drink normally—neither over-hydrating nor restricting fluids. Excessive water intake in the 2 hours before a scan can slightly underestimate body fat, as the extra water is classified as lean tissue. Conversely, scanning when dehydrated (from illness, post-sauna, or after heavy sweating without rehydration) can slightly overestimate body fat. Consistency across visits matters most: if you scanned well-hydrated last time, aim for the same conditions this time.

:::note
Under normal hydration, the effect on body fat percentage is small (1-2%). Consistency matters more than perfection.

### Food and Drink

Recent meals add mass that the scanner must account for, and food in the digestive tract may be assigned to the wrong tissue compartment. The best practice is to scan in a similar fed state each time—either fasted or after a light meal—so that this variable remains constant across visits. Large meals within 2 hours of scanning should be avoided. Alcohol should be avoided for 24 hours before scanning because it affects fluid distribution. Caffeine in normal amounts does not meaningfully affect results.

### Exercise

Physical activity temporarily shifts fluid between compartments, which can affect the distribution of lean mass measurements. Intense exercise should be avoided for 12 to 24 hours before scanning, though light activity such as walking or stretching is fine. The concern is exercise-induced fluid shifts rather than any effect on actual muscle tissue.

### Timing

Scanning at a similar time of day for each visit controls for the natural fluctuations in body composition metrics that occur throughout the day due to food intake, water consumption, and gravity-related fluid shifts. Morning scans tend to be the most consistent because overnight fasting normalizes hydration status.

## At Your Scan

### Clothing

Lightweight, form-fitting clothing without metal is ideal—athletic wear works well. Jewelry, belts, and anything with metal fasteners or zippers should be removed, as metal can create artifacts in the X-ray image. Wearing similar clothing at each visit maintains consistency. BodySpec provides appropriate scanning attire if needed.

### Positioning

Consistent positioning is critical for accurate comparisons between scans. You will lie still on the padded table in the position the technician directs, with arms at your sides and palms facing down, feet together and slightly turned inward. BodySpec technicians follow standardized positioning protocols to ensure that regional measurements are comparable from scan to scan.

### During the Scan

The scan itself is straightforward and painless—you simply lie on a padded table for approximately 6 to 7 minutes. Staying still is important because movement introduces measurement artifacts. Breathing normally throughout the scan is fine and does not affect results.

## Special Considerations

### Menstrual Cycle

Fluid retention during menstruation can affect lean mass readings by 1 to 2 pounds. For maximum consistency, tracking where you are in your cycle and aiming to scan at the same phase each time (if practical) helps minimize this variability. That said, the effect is small enough that trends still emerge clearly even without perfect cycle-phase matching.

### Medications

Some medications affect fluid distribution in ways that can influence DEXA readings. Diuretics can cause dehydration artifacts, while corticosteroids can cause fluid retention. The key principle is not to change your medication routine for a scan—consistency in medication timing relative to the scan is more important than any specific medication state.

### Recent Travel

Long flights cause fluid shifts (swelling in legs, dehydration). Wait 24-48 hours after significant travel before scanning.

## Consistency Checklist

The following checklist summarizes the key factors that ensure comparable results across visits. No single factor is critical on its own—what matters is maintaining the same conditions each time so that differences between scans reflect genuine body composition changes rather than preparation-related variability.

- [ ] Similar time of day
- [ ] Similar hydration and meal status
- [ ] No intense exercise in the past 12-24 hours
- [ ] Lightweight clothing without metal
- [ ] Same scanner location (when possible)

:::tip
Perfect conditions aren't required for useful data — consistent conditions are. The goal is comparing apples to apples across visits so that real changes in body composition are distinguishable from preparation-related variability.
