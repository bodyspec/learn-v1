# MSK Relevance of Body Composition

Body composition directly impacts musculoskeletal health and function. Understanding these relationships enhances chiropractic assessment and treatment planning.

## Body Composition and Structural Load

### Excess Fat Mass

Increased fat mass affects the musculoskeletal system through:

- **Mechanical load:** Every pound of body weight adds approximately 4 pounds of force through the knee during walking (Messier et al., 2005)[^1]
- **Postural stress:** Central adiposity shifts the center of gravity forward
- **Joint compression:** Increased axial loading on spinal structures

Patients with elevated body fat, particularly android distribution, often present with chronic low back pain that improves with body composition changes.

### Lean Mass and Support

Adequate muscle mass provides:

- Joint stability and protection
- Shock absorption during movement
- Postural support
- Load distribution

Research demonstrates that lean mass is positively associated with joint stability and functional capacity, and that muscle weakness is a primary risk factor for falls and musculoskeletal injury in older adults (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019)[^2].

## Regional Analysis Applications

### Trunk Composition

Trunk lean mass correlates with:
- Core stability
- Spinal support
- Ability to maintain neutral posture

Low trunk lean mass may indicate:
- Core weakness contributing to LBP
- Need for stabilization exercises
- Compensation patterns elsewhere

### Limb Asymmetries

DEXA reveals left-right differences that inform assessment:

| Asymmetry Level | Clinical Implication |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| <5% | Normal variation |
| 5-10% | Monitor, may be functional |
| 10-15% | Likely compensatory, address |
| >15% | Significant, investigate cause |

## Common Presentations

### Low Back Pain Patients

Body composition findings commonly seen:
- Elevated VAT (android fat distribution)
- Low trunk lean mass
- Possible leg asymmetry from guarding

### Neck Pain Patients

Consider:
- Upper extremity lean mass for supporting structures
- Forward head posture compensation for central adiposity

### Joint Pain Patients

Evaluate:
- Overall load (body fat)
- Supporting muscle mass (lean mass)
- Regional distribution affecting mechanics

## Implications for Treatment

### Exercise Prescription

DEXA informs exercise recommendations:
- Low lean mass → emphasis on resistance training
- High VAT → cardiovascular and metabolic focus
- Asymmetries → unilateral corrective work

### Prognosis Considerations

Body composition affects treatment outcomes:
- Higher body fat → longer recovery times
- Low lean mass → reduced joint stability
- Good muscle mass → better response to care

## Tracking Progress

Serial DEXA provides objective measures of:
- Muscle development from prescribed exercises
- Fat loss from lifestyle modifications
- Symmetry improvements with rehabilitation

This data complements functional assessments and patient-reported outcomes.
