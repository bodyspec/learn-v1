# Assessment Integration

Integrating DEXA body composition data into chiropractic assessment enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

## Adding Composition to Your Assessment

### Initial Evaluation

When reviewing a patient's DEXA results during initial evaluation:

1. **Note overall composition:** Body fat %, lean mass
2. **Assess regional balance:** Arm/leg asymmetries
3. **Evaluate trunk composition:** Core muscle mass
4. **Check VAT:** Metabolic and postural implications

### Correlating Findings

Connect DEXA findings to clinical presentation:

| DEXA Finding | Clinical Correlation |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Low trunk lean mass | Core instability, chronic LBP |
| Leg asymmetry >10% | Gait abnormality, compensation |
| High VAT + central fat | Increased lumbar lordosis, facet loading |
| Low overall lean mass | Generalized deconditioning |

## Case Integration Examples

### Case 1: Chronic Low Back Pain

**DEXA findings:**
- Body fat: 34%
- VAT: 156 cm²
- Low trunk lean mass
- R leg lean > L leg by 8%

**Integration:**
- Elevated VAT contributes to anterior weight shift
- Low core mass reduces spinal stability
- Leg asymmetry suggests guarding pattern
- Treatment plan includes core strengthening and addressing left leg weakness

### Case 2: Shoulder Pain

**DEXA findings:**
- R arm lean mass 12% lower than L
- Overall adequate lean mass
- Low body fat (athletic patient)

**Integration:**
- Asymmetry in a right-handed patient is opposite expected
- Suggests injury, deconditioning, or disuse
- Rehabilitation should address right upper extremity

## Progress Monitoring

Use serial DEXA to track:

### Rehabilitation Success
- Muscle mass improvements in targeted regions
- Symmetry restoration
- Core strength development (trunk lean mass)

### Overall Health
- Body composition improvements
- VAT reduction with lifestyle changes
- Lean mass preservation or gain

:::tip
Schedule follow-up scans to coincide with treatment plan milestones. This provides objective data for both assessment and patient motivation.

## Communicating Findings

When discussing DEXA results with patients:

1. **Connect to their complaint:** "Your core muscle mass is lower than expected, which may be contributing to your back pain stability issues."

2. **Make it actionable:** "The exercises I'm prescribing specifically target improving this muscle balance."

3. **Set measurable goals:** "We'll repeat the scan in 3-4 months to see if the strengthening work is showing results."

## Documentation

Include in clinical notes:
- Relevant DEXA metrics
- How findings inform diagnosis
- Treatment modifications based on composition
- Goals for follow-up scan

This creates a clear record connecting objective data to clinical decision-making.
