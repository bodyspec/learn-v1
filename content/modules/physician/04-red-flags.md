# Red Flags & Referrals

DEXA body composition results can reveal findings that warrant further investigation or specialist referral. Recognizing these patterns ensures appropriate follow-up.

## Metabolic Red Flags

![Red flags threshold gauges](/content/assets/diagrams/red-flags-thresholds.png)

### Severely Elevated VAT

**Finding:** VAT area >200 cm²[^1]

**Concerns:**
- High metabolic disease risk
- May indicate insulin resistance
- Associated with NAFLD/NASH

**Actions:**
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- Consider liver function tests
- Lipid panel if not recent
- Evaluate for metabolic syndrome
- Consider GLP-1 agonist or other medication intervention

:::warning
VAT >200 cm² warrants aggressive intervention, particularly in younger patients where this level suggests significant metabolic dysfunction.
:::

### Rapid Fat Accumulation

**Finding:** >10% increase in fat mass over 3-6 months without intentional weight gain

**Concerns:**
- Endocrine dysfunction (Cushing's, hypothyroidism)
- Medication effect
- Significant lifestyle change
- Depression or other psychiatric condition

**Actions:**
- Detailed medication review
- Thyroid panel
- Morning cortisol if appropriate
- Mental health screening

## Sarcopenia Red Flags

### Severe Muscle Deficit

**Finding:** FFMI <16 in men, <13 in women (well below 5th percentile)

**Concerns:**
- Advanced sarcopenia
- Possible underlying disease
- Malnutrition
- Functional impairment likely

**Actions:**
- Functional assessment (grip strength, gait speed)
- Nutritional evaluation
- Screen for underlying conditions
- Consider physical therapy referral

### Rapid Muscle Loss

**Finding:** >5% lean mass loss in 3-6 months without intentional caloric restriction[^2]

**Concerns:**
- Occult malignancy
- Inflammatory condition
- Malabsorption
- Severe depression
- Medication effect (corticosteroids)

**Actions:**
- CBC, CMP, inflammatory markers
- Age-appropriate cancer screening
- Detailed review of symptoms
- GI evaluation if indicated

:::clinical
Unexplained rapid muscle loss in an adult should prompt evaluation for underlying malignancy or serious systemic disease.
:::

## Asymmetry Red Flags

### Significant Limb Asymmetry

**Finding:** >15% difference in lean mass between matched limbs[^3]

**Concerns:**
- Previous injury not fully rehabilitated
- Neurological condition
- Undiagnosed injury
- Compensation pattern leading to injury risk

**Actions:**
- Detailed history of injury/surgery
- Neurological examination if no clear cause
- Physical therapy referral for rehabilitation
- Consider imaging if structural concern

### New Asymmetry on Serial Scan

**Finding:** Asymmetry that wasn't present on prior scan

**Concerns:**
- Recent injury (possibly occult)
- Nerve injury
- Activity change causing imbalance

**Actions:**
- Detailed interval history
- Focused examination of affected area
- Imaging if trauma suspected

## Composition Pattern Red Flags

### Cachexia Pattern

**Finding:** Low fat mass + low lean mass + unintentional weight loss[^4]

**Concerns:**
- Cancer cachexia
- Advanced heart failure
- End-stage liver disease
- Severe COPD
- HIV/AIDS wasting

**Actions:**
- Comprehensive evaluation for underlying disease
- Nutritional support
- Disease-specific management

### Sarcopenic Obesity

**Finding:** High body fat + low lean mass (relative to size)

**Concerns:**
- Highest functional risk
- Poor surgical outcomes
- Falls and fractures
- Metabolic dysfunction

**Actions:**
- Combined nutrition and exercise intervention
- Assess functional capacity
- Consider medication effects
- May need supervised exercise program

:::note
Sarcopenic obesity carries higher health risks than either condition alone. These patients need comprehensive intervention addressing both excess fat and insufficient muscle.

## Bone Density Findings

### Low Whole-Body BMD

**Finding:** Whole-body BMD significantly below age-expected values

**Important:** Whole-body DEXA is not diagnostic for osteoporosis

**Actions:**
- Refer for site-specific DEXA (hip and spine) if indicated
- Do not diagnose or treat osteoporosis based on whole-body scan alone
- Consider FRAX score for fracture risk assessment

## When to Refer

### Endocrinology Referral

Consider for:
- Unexplained severe or rapid composition changes
- Suspected Cushing's syndrome
- Suspected hypogonadism affecting composition
- Resistant obesity with metabolic dysfunction

### Physical Medicine / Physical Therapy

Consider for:
- Significant asymmetries requiring rehabilitation
- Sarcopenia with functional impairment
- Post-injury composition deficits
- Need for supervised strength training

### Nutrition / Dietitian

Consider for:
- Inability to gain or preserve muscle despite training
- Suspected malnutrition or malabsorption
- Complex dietary needs (cancer, renal disease)
- Eating disorder concerns

### Psychiatry / Psychology

Consider for:
- Body dysmorphia concerns despite normal results
- Disordered eating patterns
- Composition changes associated with psychiatric medication

## Documentation for Referrals

Include in referral:
- Key DEXA metrics
- Comparison to prior scans if available
- Clinical concern
- What you've already ruled out
- Specific question for specialist

## Summary

Red flags on DEXA body composition warrant appropriate follow-up but should not cause alarm without clinical correlation. The goal is early identification of treatable conditions and appropriate specialist involvement when needed.
