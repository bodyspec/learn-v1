# Clinical Indications for DEXA Body Composition

Body composition assessment via DEXA provides clinically actionable data for a wide range of conditions. Understanding when and why to recommend DEXA scanning helps optimize patient care.

## Primary Clinical Indications

### Metabolic Assessment

**When to consider:**
- Elevated fasting glucose or HbA1c
- Metabolic syndrome features
- Family history of type 2 diabetes
- PCOS with insulin resistance features

**What DEXA adds:**
- VAT quantification provides metabolic risk stratification beyond BMI
- Identifies "metabolically obese normal weight" individuals
- Tracks response to interventions

:::clinical
VAT is an independent predictor of metabolic disease risk (Neeland et al., 2019)[^1]. Two patients with identical BMI can have vastly different VAT levels and correspondingly different risk profiles.

### Sarcopenia Screening

**When to consider:**
- Adults over 65
- Unexplained weight loss
- Functional decline
- Falls history
- Chronic disease (cancer, COPD, heart failure, CKD)

**What DEXA adds:**
- Quantifies lean mass and FFMI
- Identifies early sarcopenia before functional impairment
- Monitors muscle-wasting conditions
- Assesses appendicular lean mass (ALM) for sarcopenia diagnosis

### Weight Management

**When to consider:**
- Obesity management programs
- Medical weight loss interventions
- Bariatric surgery planning and follow-up
- Concerns about muscle preservation during weight loss

**What DEXA adds:**
- Distinguishes fat loss from muscle loss
- Identifies if weight loss is "successful" (fat loss with lean preservation)
- Detects regain patterns
- Provides objective progress metrics

### Endocrine Disorders

**When to consider:**
- Hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism
- Cushing's syndrome
- Hypogonadism
- Growth hormone deficiency
- Adrenal disorders

**What DEXA adds:**
- Baseline and follow-up composition assessment
- Tracks impact of hormone optimization
- Identifies composition changes before weight changes

## Secondary Clinical Applications

### Chronic Disease Monitoring

| Condition | DEXA Utility |
|-----------|--------------|
| Cancer cachexia | Track lean mass during treatment |
| HIV/AIDS | Monitor lipodystrophy and muscle wasting |
| Liver disease | Assess sarcopenia (poor prognostic indicator) |
| Renal failure | Track composition between dialysis |
| COPD | Identify muscle wasting phenotype |

### Medication Effects

DEXA can track body composition changes related to:
- Corticosteroid therapy (increased VAT, decreased lean mass)
- Antiretroviral therapy (lipodystrophy)
- Antipsychotics (metabolic effects)
- GLP-1 agonists (composition of weight loss)

:::note
For patients on GLP-1 medications like semaglutide, DEXA can differentiate desired fat loss from concerning muscle loss—an important distinction for long-term outcomes (Wilding et al., 2021)[^2].

### Athletic/Performance Medicine

**When to consider:**
- Pre-participation physicals
- Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)
- Weight-class sport athletes
- Female Athlete Triad concerns
- Return-to-play assessment

### Research and Clinical Trials

DEXA is the accepted standard for body composition endpoints in:
- Pharmaceutical trials
- Nutrition intervention studies
- Exercise science research

## Contraindications and Limitations

### Relative Contraindications
- Pregnancy (or possibility of pregnancy)
- Recent barium or nuclear medicine studies
- Significant movement disorders
- Unable to lie flat for 7 minutes

### Not Diagnostic For
- Osteoporosis (requires site-specific BMD protocol)
- Specific metabolic disorders
- Inflammatory conditions

### Size Limitations
Most DEXA tables accommodate patients up to approximately:
- 350-400 lbs (varies by machine)
- 6'6" height

## Ordering Considerations

When recommending DEXA body composition:

1. **Frame the purpose:** Help patients understand why composition matters beyond weight
2. **Set expectations:** First scan establishes baseline; value increases with tracking
3. **Consider frequency:** 3-6 months for active interventions; annually for maintenance
4. **Integrate with care:** Connect results to specific health goals and interventions
