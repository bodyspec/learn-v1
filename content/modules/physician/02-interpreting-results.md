# Interpreting Results Clinically

Clinical interpretation of DEXA body composition requires integrating multiple metrics with the patient's overall clinical picture. No single number drives a clinical decision—rather, the combination of body composition data, patient history, and clinical context together inform actionable recommendations.

## Framework for Interpretation

### Step 1: Review Key Metrics

A structured approach to reviewing DEXA results begins with the metrics that carry the greatest clinical weight. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is the primary metabolic risk indicator and should be evaluated first. Body fat percentage provides an overall composition assessment. Lean mass and FFMI (Fat-Free Mass Index) characterize muscle health and sarcopenia risk. The A/G ratio reveals fat distribution patterns that carry independent metabolic significance. Regional asymmetries flag potential functional concerns that may warrant further evaluation.

### Step 2: Apply Clinical Context

The clinical significance of any given metric depends heavily on the patient's individual circumstances. Age and sex fundamentally alter reference ranges and risk thresholds. Comorbidities modify the interpretation and urgency of findings. Current medications may be driving body composition changes. Activity level establishes the baseline against which results are interpreted. Treatment goals determine which metrics are most relevant and what changes are desired.

## Metabolic Risk Assessment

### VAT-Based Risk Stratification

Visceral adipose tissue area provides the most direct DEXA-based assessment of metabolic risk. The following thresholds guide risk stratification, with the recognition that metabolic risk exists on a continuum and sex-based differences influence the clinical significance of any given measurement.

| VAT Area | Men | Women | Clinical Action |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------------|
| <100 cm² | Low risk | Low risk | Reinforce current habits |
| 100-130 cm² | Moderate | Elevated | Lifestyle counseling |
| 130-160 cm² | Elevated | High | Structured intervention |
| >160 cm² | High | Very high | Medical management consideration |

### The TOFI Phenotype

The "Thin Outside, Fat Inside" (TOFI) phenotype describes patients who present with a normal or only slightly elevated BMI but harbor elevated visceral fat, typically exceeding 100 cm² VAT area. These individuals often have an elevated A/G ratio above 1.0 alongside normal subcutaneous fat levels—a combination that makes their metabolic risk invisible to standard anthropometric screening.

The clinical significance of the TOFI phenotype is substantial. These patients carry higher metabolic risk than their BMI suggests, are frequently missed by standard screening protocols that rely on weight or waist circumference, and yet respond well to targeted exercise intervention. DEXA body composition analysis is one of the few tools capable of identifying this population before metabolic disease becomes clinically apparent.

## Sarcopenia Assessment

### Diagnostic Criteria

Sarcopenia assessment using DEXA follows the EWGSOP2 criteria (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019)[^1], with appendicular lean mass (ALM) serving as the primary body composition measurement. The diagnostic cut-points for low muscle mass are ALM/height² below 7.0 kg/m² for men and below 5.5 kg/m² for women. These thresholds identify the muscle mass component of sarcopenia, which should be combined with functional testing (grip strength, gait speed) for a complete diagnosis.

### Risk Factors for Sarcopenia

Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for sarcopenia in patients who present with established risk factors. Age over 65 is the most prominent risk factor, but recent hospitalization, chronic inflammatory conditions, inadequate protein intake, physical inactivity, and unintentional weight loss all increase the likelihood of clinically significant muscle deficit. When multiple risk factors are present, DEXA-based lean mass assessment and functional testing become particularly valuable for early detection.

### Clinical Implications

The clinical consequences of sarcopenia extend across multiple domains. Patients with sarcopenia experience increased fall risk that compounds fracture likelihood, longer hospital stays with more complications, higher rates of post-surgical complications, increased mortality in the setting of chronic disease, and reduced quality of life driven by progressive functional limitation. These consequences are not merely theoretical—they translate into measurable differences in clinical outcomes that make sarcopenia identification a high-value clinical activity.

## Weight Loss Quality Assessment

Not all weight loss is clinically equivalent, and DEXA provides the data needed to evaluate weight loss quality. The composition of weight lost—the proportion coming from fat versus lean tissue—determines the metabolic and functional consequences of weight reduction.

### Favorable Weight Loss Pattern

A favorable weight loss pattern is characterized by primary fat mass reduction with minimal lean mass loss accounting for less than 25 percent of total weight lost, accompanied by VAT reduction. This pattern preserves metabolic rate, maintains functional capacity, and produces the best long-term outcomes.

### Concerning Weight Loss Pattern

A concerning pattern shows significant lean mass loss exceeding 25 percent of total weight lost, disproportionate muscle loss relative to fat loss, or—most problematically—a stable or increasing body fat percentage despite scale weight decreasing. This last finding indicates that the patient is losing more lean tissue than fat, which worsens body composition even as weight declines.

## Age-Related Changes

### Expected Changes with Aging

Understanding the expected trajectory of body composition changes with aging helps clinicians distinguish normal aging from pathological decline. The following patterns represent typical age-related changes in the general population.

| Decade | Typical Changes |
|--------|-----------------|
| 30s | Lean mass peaks; fat may begin increasing |
| 40s | 3-8% lean mass decline per decade begins[^2] |
| 50s | Accelerated lean loss; VAT accumulation |
| 60s+ | Sarcopenia risk increases significantly |

### Hormone-Related Changes

Hormonal transitions produce predictable shifts in body composition that clinicians should anticipate. **Menopause** triggers a redistribution of fat from gynoid to android patterns, accelerates lean mass loss, and drives increased VAT accumulation—often without a corresponding change in total body weight. These shifts can transform a patient's metabolic risk profile even when the scale weight remains stable.

**Andropause** produces a more gradual but persistent decline in lean mass accompanied by increased central adiposity. Unlike the relatively abrupt changes of menopause, andropause-related body composition shifts unfold over years to decades. Testosterone optimization, when clinically appropriate, may be a modifiable factor in slowing these changes.

## Serial Scan Interpretation

### Meaningful Changes

Interpreting serial DEXA scans requires distinguishing genuine physiological changes from measurement variability. Changes are generally considered clinically significant when body fat percentage shifts by more than 2 percentage points, lean mass changes by more than 1 kilogram, or VAT changes by more than 20 square centimeters. Smaller changes may fall within the precision limits of the measurement and should be interpreted cautiously.

### Trend Analysis

The greatest clinical value from serial DEXA scans emerges from trend analysis across three or more measurements. A consistent directional trend across multiple scans provides much stronger evidence of genuine change than any single-scan comparison. Single-scan variations may represent noise from hydration status, time of day, or positioning differences. The rate of change is also clinically relevant—rapid lean mass decline warrants more urgent intervention than gradual shifts.

## Integration with Lab Data

DEXA body composition findings gain additional clinical power when integrated with laboratory data, as the two data sources often corroborate and contextualize each other.

| DEXA Finding | Lab Correlation |
|--------------|-----------------|
| High VAT | ↑ Fasting insulin, ↑ triglycerides, ↓ HDL |
| Low lean mass | ↓ Creatinine, ↓ albumin |
| Rapid muscle loss | ↑ CRP, ↓ IGF-1 |

When DEXA findings and lab values align, the clinical picture is strengthened. When they diverge—for example, low lean mass with normal albumin—the discrepancy itself provides useful clinical information and may warrant further investigation.
