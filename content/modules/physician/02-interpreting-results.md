# Interpreting Results Clinically

Clinical interpretation of DEXA body composition requires integrating multiple metrics with the patient's overall clinical picture.

## Framework for Interpretation

### Step 1: Review Key Metrics

Prioritize these metrics for clinical decision-making:

1. **Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT)** - Metabolic risk
2. **Body Fat Percentage** - Overall composition
3. **Lean Mass / FFMI** - Muscle health
4. **A/G Ratio** - Fat distribution pattern
5. **Regional Asymmetries** - Functional concerns

### Step 2: Apply Clinical Context

The same metrics have different implications depending on:
- Age and sex
- Comorbidities
- Medications
- Activity level
- Treatment goals

A 25% body fat in a 30-year-old sedentary male has different implications than in a 70-year-old female recovering from hip replacement surgery.

## Metabolic Risk Assessment

### VAT-Based Risk Stratification

| VAT Area | Men | Women | Clinical Action |
|----------|-----|-------|-----------------|
| <100 cm² | Low risk | Low risk | Reinforce current habits |
| 100-130 cm² | Moderate | Elevated | Lifestyle counseling |
| 130-160 cm² | Elevated | High | Structured intervention |
| >160 cm² | High | Very high | Medical management consideration |

### The TOFI Phenotype

"Thin Outside, Fat Inside" patients have:
- Normal or slightly elevated BMI
- Elevated VAT (>100 cm²)
- Elevated A/G ratio (>1.0)
- Often normal subcutaneous fat

**Clinical significance:**
- Higher metabolic risk than BMI suggests
- May be missed by standard screening
- Responds well to exercise intervention

:::warning
Don't dismiss metabolic risk based on "normal weight" appearance. VAT can be elevated even in lean-appearing individuals.

## Sarcopenia Assessment

### Diagnostic Criteria

Using EWGSOP2 criteria:
- **Appendicular lean mass (ALM) cut-points:**
  - Men: <7.0 kg/m² (ALM/height²)
  - Women: <5.5 kg/m² (ALM/height²)

### Risk Factors for Sarcopenia

Look for sarcopenia risk in patients with:
- Age >65
- Recent hospitalization
- Chronic inflammatory conditions
- Inadequate protein intake
- Physical inactivity
- Unintentional weight loss

### Clinical Implications

Sarcopenia is associated with:
- Increased fall risk
- Longer hospital stays
- Post-surgical complications
- Higher mortality in chronic disease
- Reduced quality of life

## Weight Loss Quality Assessment

Not all weight loss is equal. DEXA allows you to evaluate:

### Favorable Weight Loss Pattern
- Primary fat mass reduction
- Minimal lean mass loss (<25% of total weight lost)
- VAT reduction

### Concerning Weight Loss Pattern
- Significant lean mass loss (>25% of total)
- Disproportionate muscle loss
- Stable or increasing fat percentage despite weight loss

:::tip
When patients lose weight, ask: "What type of tissue did they lose?" This determines long-term metabolic and functional outcomes.

## Age-Related Changes

### Expected Changes with Aging

| Decade | Typical Changes |
|--------|-----------------|
| 30s | Lean mass peaks; fat may begin increasing |
| 40s | 3-8% lean mass decline per decade begins |
| 50s | Accelerated lean loss; VAT accumulation |
| 60s+ | Sarcopenia risk increases significantly |

### Hormone-Related Changes

**Menopause:**
- Shift from gynoid to android fat distribution
- Accelerated lean mass loss
- Increased VAT accumulation

**Andropause:**
- Gradual lean mass decline
- Increased central adiposity
- May be modifiable with testosterone optimization

## Serial Scan Interpretation

### Meaningful Changes

Consider changes clinically significant if:
- Body fat % changes >2%
- Lean mass changes >1 kg
- VAT changes >20 cm²

Smaller changes may be within measurement precision.

### Trend Analysis

Focus on patterns over 3+ scans:
- Consistent direction indicates real change
- Single-scan variations may be noise
- Rate of change matters for intervention planning

## Integration with Lab Data

DEXA findings correlate with:

| DEXA Finding | Lab Correlation |
|--------------|-----------------|
| High VAT | ↑ Fasting insulin, ↑ triglycerides, ↓ HDL |
| Low lean mass | ↓ Creatinine, ↓ albumin |
| Rapid muscle loss | ↑ CRP, ↓ IGF-1 |

Use DEXA to add context to lab results and track response to interventions.
