# Client Management with DEXA

DEXA transforms client conversations from subjective assessments to objective data. Use this data to set expectations, demonstrate progress, and maintain motivation.

## Setting Expectations

### First Scan Discussion

When reviewing initial DEXA results:

1. **Normalize the data:** "DEXA is more accurate than consumer devices—many people are surprised their body fat is higher than their scale says."

2. **Frame as a starting point:** "This gives us a precise baseline to work from. The numbers matter less than how they change."

3. **Set realistic goals:** "Based on where you are now, here's what we can realistically target in the next 12 weeks."

### Goal Setting Framework

| Starting Point | 12-Week Goal | Focus |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| >30% BF | -3-6% body fat | Fat loss, muscle preservation |
| 25-30% BF | -2-4% body fat | Balanced approach |
| <25% BF + low muscle | +2-4 lbs lean mass | Building |
| Athletic | Specific targets | Sport-specific |

## Demonstrating Progress

### Beyond the Scale

DEXA shows progress that scales miss:

**Scenario:** Client's weight is unchanged after 8 weeks

**Scale says:** No progress

**DEXA says:** Lost 4 lbs fat, gained 4 lbs muscle

**Your message:** "This is exactly what we want—body recomposition. You're replacing fat with muscle. The scale can't show you this, but DEXA can."

### Visualizing Changes

Use DEXA reports to show:
- Regional changes (where muscle was gained)
- Fat loss patterns
- Symmetry improvements
- Percentile rank changes

## Handling Difficult Conversations

### Results Don't Match Effort

When a client's DEXA doesn't show expected progress:

1. **Acknowledge their effort:** "I know you've been working hard."
2. **Explore factors:** Training consistency, nutrition adherence, sleep, stress
3. **Check expectations:** Were goals realistic for the timeframe?
4. **Adjust plan:** Make specific changes based on findings

### Results Are Worse Than Expected

Sometimes composition goes the wrong direction:

1. **Stay calm:** Emotional reactions aren't helpful
2. **Investigate:** Life changes, injuries, adherence issues
3. **Reframe if appropriate:** Sometimes muscle loss reflects valid priorities (injury recovery, life stress)
4. **Plan forward:** Focus on what we can control going forward

### Client Fixated on Weight

For clients who can't stop focusing on the scale:

"I want you to look at these two numbers: your body fat went from 28% to 25%, and your lean mass increased by 3 pounds. That's a 6-pound composition swing in the right direction, even though your weight only dropped 2 pounds. The scale is telling you one story; your body composition is telling a much better one."

## Motivation and Retention

### Using Data for Accountability

DEXA creates external accountability:
- Scheduled scans provide milestones
- Objective data removes guesswork
- Progress is visible and undeniable

### Celebrating Wins

Highlight improvements explicitly:
- "You gained 2 pounds of muscle—that's metabolically active tissue that burns more calories."
- "Your VAT dropped 20%—that's a significant health improvement."
- "Your leg asymmetry improved—the corrective work is paying off."

### Building Long-Term Relationships

Regular DEXA tracking:
- Creates ongoing touchpoints
- Provides reasons to check in
- Demonstrates value of your programming
- Builds data-driven trust

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Review results together, explaining each metric
- Connect findings to specific program elements
- Set concrete goals for next scan
- Celebrate progress, however small
- Use data to refine programming

### Don't:
- Make clients feel bad about results
- Promise specific outcomes you can't control
- Ignore concerning patterns
- Over-interpret small changes (within precision bounds)
- Compare clients to each other

## Documentation

Keep records of:
- All DEXA results
- Goals set at each scan
- Programming adjustments based on data
- Client responses and feedback

This history becomes valuable for understanding what works for each client over time.
