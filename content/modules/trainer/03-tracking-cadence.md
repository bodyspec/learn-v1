# Tracking & Cadence

Optimal scan frequency depends on goals, timeline, and stage of training. Strategic timing maximizes the value of DEXA data.

## Recommended Scan Frequency

### General Guidelines

| Phase | Frequency | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Initial assessment | Baseline | Establish starting point |
| Active transformation | Every 8-12 weeks | Track meaningful changes |
| Maintenance | Every 4-6 months | Ensure stability |
| Annual check-in | Yearly minimum | Long-term trends |

### By Goal Type

**Fat Loss Programs:**
- Initial scan before starting
- Follow-up at 8-12 weeks
- Continue every 2-3 months until goal
- Transition to maintenance frequency

**Muscle Building:**
- Initial scan
- 12-16 week follow-up (muscle gains are slower)
- Quarterly thereafter

**Body Recomposition:**
- Initial scan
- 12-week minimum before rescan (recomp is slow)
- Avoid frequent scanning—can be discouraging

:::note
More frequent scanning rarely provides better data. Changes within 6-8 weeks are often within measurement precision and can mislead rather than inform (Shepherd et al., 2017)[^1].

## Timing Considerations

### Best Practices for Scan Day

Advise clients to:
- Scan at consistent time of day
- Maintain similar hydration status
- Avoid intense exercise 24 hours prior
- Wear similar, minimal clothing
- Use the same scanner location

### Avoid Scanning When:

- Immediately after diet break or vacation (fluid shifts)
- During illness (dehydration, inflammation)
- After recent travel (hydration changes)
- During menstruation (fluid retention)

## Using Trends, Not Snapshots

### Pattern Recognition

Single scans are snapshots; trends tell stories:

| Pattern | Interpretation | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Consistent fat loss | Program working | Continue |
| Fat loss stalling | Adaptation or adherence | Adjust |
| Muscle gain plateauing | Progressive overload needed | Intensify |
| Gaining fat + muscle | Caloric surplus too aggressive | Moderate |
| Losing muscle + fat | Deficit too aggressive | Increase calories |

### Minimum Data Points

- 2 scans: Direction only
- 3 scans: Trend confirmation
- 4+ scans: Reliable pattern

## Integrating with Other Metrics

DEXA provides periodic objective data. Complement with:

### Weekly/Daily Tracking
- Scale weight (daily or weekly average)
- Measurements (waist, hips, limbs)
- Progress photos
- Performance metrics (strength, endurance)

### How Metrics Relate

| DEXA Shows | Daily Metrics Might Show |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Muscle gain | Strength increases, stable weight |
| Fat loss | Weight down, measurements down |
| Recomposition | Weight stable, measurements down, strength up |

:::tip
When daily metrics and DEXA diverge, trust the DEXA. It's more accurate and less subject to day-to-day variation.

## Client Communication Around Timing

### Setting Expectations

"We'll do your baseline scan now, then I'd like to rescan in about 12 weeks. That's enough time for real changes to show up—scanning too often can be frustrating because natural variations can look like bad news."

### Between Scans

"Your weekly weigh-ins and measurements will give us directional feedback. The DEXA in 12 weeks will confirm what's actually happening with your body composition."

### After Reaching Goals

"Now that you're in maintenance, we'll scan every 4-6 months just to make sure you're staying on track. These periodic check-ins catch any drift before it becomes significant."

## Creating a Scanning Schedule

### Sample Timeline: 6-Month Fat Loss Client

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0 | Baseline DEXA |
| 1-10 | Training + nutrition, weekly check-ins |
| 10 | Progress DEXA #1 |
| 11-20 | Adjusted program based on data |
| 20 | Progress DEXA #2 |
| 21-24 | Final push or transition to maintenance |
| 24 | Final DEXA |
| Ongoing | Maintenance scans every 4-6 months |

### Sample Timeline: Muscle Building Client

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 0 | Baseline DEXA |
| 1-16 | Progressive overload training, surplus |
| 16 | Progress DEXA #1 |
| 17-32 | Continued training, adjusted nutrition |
| 32 | Progress DEXA #2 |
| Ongoing | Quarterly scans during building, less frequent in maintenance |

## Summary

Strategic scan timing maximizes DEXA value. Space scans far enough apart to see meaningful changes, use consistent conditions for comparable results, and complement periodic DEXA with more frequent surrogate measures. Trends over multiple scans provide the most actionable insights.
