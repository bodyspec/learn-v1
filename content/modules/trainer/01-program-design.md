# Program Design with DEXA Data

DEXA body composition data transforms programming from guesswork into precision. Use objective metrics to design programs that match each client's starting point and goals.

## Using DEXA for Needs Assessment

### Initial Client Evaluation

When a new client brings DEXA results, assess:

1. **Body fat percentage:** Overall starting point
2. **Lean mass:** Current muscle base
3. **Regional distribution:** Symmetry and weak points
4. **VAT:** Metabolic health indicator

### Categorizing Clients

| Profile | Characteristics | Primary Focus |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Underweight/Low muscle | Low lean mass, low fat | Build muscle, caloric surplus |
| Skinny fat | Normal weight, high fat %, low muscle | Recomposition, resistance priority |
| Overweight/Low muscle | High fat, low lean mass | Fat loss + muscle preservation |
| Overweight/Good muscle | High fat, good lean base | Fat loss, maintain training |
| Athletic recomp | Moderate fat, good muscle | Fine-tuning, specific goals |

## Programming Strategies

### For Low Lean Mass Clients

**Priority:** Build muscle mass

**Program elements:**
- Progressive resistance training 3-4x/week
- Focus on compound movements
- Adequate recovery between sessions
- Protein target: 1.4-2.0g/kg bodyweight[^1]

:::tip
Clients with very low lean mass may initially gain weight while improving—their body fat percentage drops even as the scale goes up due to muscle gain.
:::

### For High Body Fat Clients

**Priority:** Fat loss while preserving muscle

**Program elements:**
- Resistance training to signal muscle retention
- Moderate cardio for caloric deficit
- High protein to preserve lean mass
- Avoid excessive caloric restriction

### For Body Recomposition

**Priority:** Simultaneously lose fat and gain muscle

**Recomposition works best when[^2]:**
- Client is new to resistance training
- Returning after layoff
- Higher starting body fat (>25% men, >30% women)
- Adequate protein intake

**Program elements:**
- Progressive resistance training
- Moderate caloric deficit or maintenance
- Very high protein (2.0g/kg+)
- Patience—scale may not move while composition improves

## Regional Programming

### Addressing Asymmetries

When DEXA shows significant limb differences:

1. **Assess cause:** Injury history, dominant side, activity patterns
2. **Unilateral work:** Include exercises that work each side independently
3. **Volume balance:** Consider extra volume for weaker side
4. **Track progress:** Follow-up DEXA shows if asymmetry is improving

### Targeting Specific Areas

While you can't spot-reduce fat, you can:
- Build muscle in specific regions
- Improve proportions through targeted hypertrophy
- Address weak links in the kinetic chain

## Setting Realistic Targets

### Muscle Gain Expectations

| Training Status | Expected Monthly Gain |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Beginner | 1-2 lbs lean mass |
| Intermediate | 0.5-1 lb lean mass |
| Advanced | 0.25-0.5 lb lean mass |

*These are general guidelines based on training experience; individual results vary.*

### Fat Loss Expectations

Sustainable fat loss: 0.5-1% of body weight per week

At this rate, a 200 lb client might lose:
- 4-8 lbs per month
- Expect some lean mass loss; goal is minimizing it

### Body Recomposition Timeline

Meaningful recomposition typically requires:
- 12-16 weeks minimum
- Consistent training adherence
- Dialed-in nutrition

## Integrating with Nutrition

DEXA helps set nutrition targets:

| Client Goal | Calories | Protein Target |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Fat loss | Deficit | 2.3-3.1 g/kg lean mass[^1] |
| Muscle gain | Surplus | 1.4-2.0 g/kg bodyweight[^1] |
| Recomposition | Slight deficit to maintenance | 2.0+ g/kg |

:::note
Protein recommendations based on lean mass are more precise than bodyweight-based recommendations, especially for clients with higher body fat.
