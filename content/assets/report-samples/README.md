## Requirements for Sample Reports

### Privacy
- All reports must be fully de-identified
- Remove: name, date of birth, scan date, facility info
- Consider using fictional data or composite examples

### Annotations
- Consider adding callout annotations highlighting key areas
- Use consistent color coding (e.g., red for concerning, green for favorable)

### File Format
- Screenshots: PNG preferred (lossless), JPG acceptable
- Full reports: PDF
- Resolution: Minimum 150 DPI for print quality

### Consent
- If using real client data, ensure proper consent/release
- Alternatively, create synthetic example reports
