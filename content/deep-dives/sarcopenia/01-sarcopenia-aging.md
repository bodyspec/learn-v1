# Understanding Sarcopenia

Sarcopenia—age-related loss of muscle mass and function—is a major factor in physical decline and loss of independence. The condition affects a substantial proportion of older adults and carries significant consequences for health outcomes, yet it remains underdiagnosed in clinical practice. Understanding how sarcopenia develops, how to identify it, and how to intervene is essential for healthcare providers working with aging populations.

## Definition and Diagnosis

### What is Sarcopenia?

The term sarcopenia derives from the Greek "sarx" (flesh) and "penia" (loss), and it describes a progressive, generalized skeletal muscle disorder involving the accelerated loss of muscle mass and function. Clinically, sarcopenia is defined by three interrelated components: low muscle mass (measured by DEXA, bioimpedance, or CT), low muscle strength (typically assessed via grip strength), and low physical performance (evaluated through gait speed or chair stand tests). The presence and severity of these components determines the diagnostic classification.

### EWGSOP2 Diagnostic Criteria

The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) published a revised consensus framework that provides a stepwise approach to diagnosis (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019)[^1]. The framework establishes three diagnostic levels based on the number of criteria met:

1. **Probable sarcopenia:** Low muscle strength alone, which serves as the initial screening finding and is sufficient to trigger clinical concern and intervention.
2. **Confirmed sarcopenia:** Low muscle strength combined with low muscle quantity or quality, providing objective evidence that the muscle deficit is structural, not merely functional.
3. **Severe sarcopenia:** All three criteria are met—low strength, low muscle quantity, and low physical performance—indicating the most advanced stage with the highest risk of adverse outcomes.

This stepwise approach prioritizes muscle strength as the entry criterion because strength declines faster than mass and is a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes than mass alone.

### DEXA Cut-Points for Low Muscle Mass

DEXA-based cut-points provide objective thresholds for identifying low muscle mass. The two most widely used indices are appendicular lean mass normalized to height squared (ALM/height²) and appendicular lean mass normalized to BMI (ALM/BMI), each with sex-specific thresholds established by the EWGSOP2 consensus (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019)[^1].

| Measure | Men | Women |
|---------|-----|-------|
| ALM/height² | <7.0 kg/m² | <5.5 kg/m² |
| ALM/BMI | <0.789 | <0.512 |

The ALM/height² index is more commonly used in clinical practice, while the ALM/BMI index may provide better discrimination in individuals with obesity, where height-based normalization can underestimate the degree of muscle deficit.

## Prevalence and Impact

### How Common is Sarcopenia?

Sarcopenia prevalence increases markedly with age, reflecting the cumulative effects of muscle loss over decades. Among adults aged 60 to 70, prevalence ranges from 5 to 13 percent. This rises substantially in the 70-to-80 age group, where estimates range from 11 to 50 percent depending on the diagnostic criteria and population studied. Among adults over 80, more than half are affected (Petermann-Rocha et al., 2022)[^2]. The wide ranges in these estimates reflect differences in diagnostic criteria, measurement methods, and population characteristics—underscoring the importance of standardized assessment approaches.

### Health Consequences

The clinical consequences of sarcopenia are substantial and well-documented. Individuals with sarcopenia face an increased risk of falls, which in turn leads to higher rates of fractures—particularly hip fractures, which carry significant morbidity and mortality in older adults. Beyond acute events, sarcopenia drives progressive functional decline that erodes the capacity for independent living. Activities that healthy adults take for granted—rising from a chair, climbing stairs, carrying groceries—become increasingly difficult as muscle mass and strength diminish. Hospitalizations are more frequent and recovery times longer, and sarcopenia is independently associated with increased all-cause mortality.

## Pathophysiology

### Why Do We Lose Muscle with Age?

Muscle loss with aging is not driven by a single mechanism but rather by the convergence of multiple biological processes that collectively shift the balance from muscle maintenance toward muscle degradation.

**Anabolic resistance** is a central driver: aging muscle becomes less responsive to the protein synthesis signals triggered by dietary protein and exercise, meaning older adults need greater stimuli to achieve the same anabolic response as younger individuals. This is compounded by **hormonal changes**—declining levels of testosterone, growth hormone, and IGF-1 reduce the body's capacity to build and maintain muscle tissue.

At the cellular level, **chronic low-grade inflammation** (sometimes called "inflammaging") creates a catabolic environment that promotes muscle protein breakdown. **Mitochondrial dysfunction** reduces the energy available for muscle maintenance and repair. **Neuromuscular changes**, including motor neuron loss and denervation of muscle fibers, reduce the nervous system's ability to activate muscle effectively—a process that accelerates after age 60.

Behavioral factors amplify these biological changes. **Reduced physical activity** and **inadequate protein intake** are modifiable contributors that, when left unaddressed, dramatically accelerate the rate of muscle loss.

### Rate of Loss

The average rate of muscle loss is approximately 3 to 8 percent per decade after age 30, though this rate is far from uniform (Mitchell et al., 2012)[^4]. Loss tends to be gradual in middle age and accelerates significantly after age 60, when the biological drivers described above intensify. The encouraging reality is that this trajectory can be dramatically slowed—and in many cases partially reversed—with appropriate intervention.

## Assessment

### Using DEXA for Sarcopenia Assessment

DEXA is the preferred method for quantifying muscle mass in sarcopenia assessment because it provides precise, reproducible measurements of lean tissue across the entire body. A single DEXA scan yields total body lean mass, appendicular lean mass (the combined lean mass of the arms and legs, which serves as a proxy for skeletal muscle), and a regional breakdown that can identify asymmetries or localized deficits.

From these measurements, clinicians calculate the key diagnostic indices. ALM/height² is the most widely used index and is straightforward to compute from standard DEXA output. ALM/BMI may be preferred in patients with obesity, where the height-based index can mask clinically significant muscle deficits behind the higher absolute lean mass that accompanies greater body weight.

### Functional Tests

DEXA quantifies muscle mass, but sarcopenia diagnosis also requires assessment of muscle function. Several validated functional tests complement DEXA data by evaluating strength and physical performance. **Grip strength** is the simplest and most predictive single measure—it requires only a handheld dynamometer and correlates strongly with overall strength and clinical outcomes. The **chair stand test** (five rises from a seated position without using the arms) evaluates lower extremity strength and power. **Gait speed** below 0.8 m/s suggests clinically significant impairment and is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. The **Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)** combines balance, gait, and chair stand assessments into a composite score that provides a comprehensive functional profile.

## Prevention and Treatment

### Resistance Training

Resistance training is the single most effective intervention for preventing and treating sarcopenia. A program of two to three sessions per week, emphasizing progressive overload and targeting major muscle groups, produces meaningful improvements in both muscle mass and strength. The evidence is consistent across age groups: resistance training is effective even in individuals over 80 and in those with significant frailty, though programming should be adapted to individual capacity and supervised when appropriate.

### Protein Optimization

Older adults require more dietary protein than younger adults to overcome anabolic resistance and support muscle maintenance. Current evidence supports a minimum intake of 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg/day, with an optimal range of 1.2 to 1.6 g/kg/day for individuals actively combating sarcopenia (Bauer et al., 2013; Deutz et al., 2014)[^5][^6]. Distribution matters as well: spreading protein intake across meals in doses of 25 to 30 grams per meal maximizes the muscle protein synthesis response. Leucine-rich protein sources—including whey protein, eggs, and lean meat—are particularly effective at stimulating muscle protein synthesis in older adults.

### Other Considerations

Beyond resistance training and protein optimization, several additional strategies support muscle health in aging populations. Vitamin D status should be assessed and corrected if deficient, as vitamin D plays a role in muscle function and falls prevention. Underlying conditions that accelerate muscle loss—including chronic diseases, hormonal deficiencies, and medication side effects—should be identified and addressed. Reducing sedentary time, even through light activity and standing, provides an additional stimulus for muscle maintenance. Creatine supplementation has emerging evidence supporting its role in enhancing the effects of resistance training in older adults.

## DEXA Monitoring

### Tracking Sarcopenia with DEXA

Serial DEXA scans provide objective, longitudinal data that transforms sarcopenia management from guesswork into evidence-based practice. Repeated measurements over time can detect early muscle loss before it becomes clinically apparent, track the effectiveness of exercise and nutrition interventions, and identify periods of rapid decline that warrant investigation for underlying causes such as illness, medication changes, or nutritional deficiency.

### Recommended Frequency

Monitoring frequency should be tailored to clinical context and risk level. High-risk patients—those with confirmed sarcopenia, recent hospitalization, or active disease processes affecting muscle—benefit from scans every 6 to 12 months. Stable patients being monitored preventively can typically be assessed annually. During periods of active intervention, such as a new resistance training program or nutritional optimization protocol, scans every 3 to 6 months provide timely feedback on whether the intervention is achieving its goals.

## Summary

Sarcopenia is a prevalent, consequential condition that can be diagnosed with DEXA and functional testing. Early identification enables intervention with resistance training and nutrition optimization to preserve muscle mass, function, and independence.
