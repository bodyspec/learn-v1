# Understanding Sarcopenia

Sarcopenia—age-related loss of muscle mass and function—is a major factor in physical decline and loss of independence. Understanding this condition is essential for healthcare providers working with aging populations.

## Definition and Diagnosis

### What is Sarcopenia?

Sarcopenia is characterized by:
- **Low muscle mass** (measured by DEXA, bioimpedance, or CT)
- **Low muscle strength** (typically grip strength)
- **Low physical performance** (gait speed, chair stand test)

The term comes from Greek: "sarx" (flesh) + "penia" (loss).

### EWGSOP2 Diagnostic Criteria

The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) recommends:

1. **Probable sarcopenia:** Low muscle strength
2. **Confirmed sarcopenia:** Low muscle strength + low muscle quantity/quality
3. **Severe sarcopenia:** All three criteria met

### DEXA Cut-Points for Low Muscle Mass

| Measure | Men | Women |
|---------|-----|-------|
| ALM/height² | <7.0 kg/m² | <5.5 kg/m² |
| ALM/BMI | <0.789 | <0.512 |

:::note
ALM = Appendicular Lean Mass (arms + legs)

## Prevalence and Impact

### How Common is Sarcopenia?

- Ages 60-70: 5-13%
- Ages 70-80: 11-50%
- Ages 80+: 50%+

Prevalence varies based on definition used and population studied.

### Health Consequences

Sarcopenia is associated with:
- Increased fall risk
- Fractures
- Functional decline
- Loss of independence
- Hospitalization
- Mortality

Sarcopenia is now recognized as a disease with its own ICD-10 code (M62.84), enabling diagnosis and treatment documentation.

## Pathophysiology

### Why Do We Lose Muscle with Age?

Multiple factors contribute:

1. **Anabolic resistance:** Reduced muscle protein synthesis response to protein and exercise
2. **Hormonal changes:** Declining testosterone, growth hormone, IGF-1
3. **Inflammation:** Chronic low-grade inflammation
4. **Mitochondrial dysfunction:** Reduced cellular energy production
5. **Neuromuscular changes:** Motor neuron loss and denervation
6. **Reduced physical activity:** Sedentary behavior accelerates loss
7. **Nutritional factors:** Inadequate protein intake

### Rate of Loss

- Average loss: 3-8% per decade after age 30
- Accelerates after age 60
- Can be dramatically slowed with intervention

## Assessment

### Using DEXA for Sarcopenia Assessment

DEXA provides:
- Total body lean mass
- Appendicular lean mass (ALM)
- Regional breakdown (arms, legs, trunk)

Calculate:
- ALM/height² (most common)
- ALM/BMI (accounts for body size better in obese)

### Functional Tests

Complement DEXA with:
- **Grip strength:** Simple, predictive of outcomes
- **Chair stand test:** 5 rises without using arms
- **Gait speed:** <0.8 m/s suggests impairment
- **SPPB:** Short Physical Performance Battery

## Prevention and Treatment

### Resistance Training

The most effective intervention:
- 2-3 sessions per week
- Progressive overload
- Focus on major muscle groups
- Can be effective at any age

### Protein Optimization

Older adults need more protein:
- Minimum: 1.0-1.2 g/kg/day
- Optimal: 1.2-1.6 g/kg/day
- Distributed across meals (25-30g per meal)
- Leucine-rich sources (whey, eggs, lean meat)

### Other Considerations

- Vitamin D optimization (if deficient)
- Address underlying conditions
- Reduce sedentary time
- Consider creatine supplementation

## DEXA Monitoring

### Tracking Sarcopenia with DEXA

Serial DEXA scans can:
- Detect early muscle loss
- Track intervention effectiveness
- Identify rapid decline requiring investigation

### Recommended Frequency

- High-risk patients: Every 6-12 months
- Stable patients: Annually
- During active intervention: Every 3-6 months

## Summary

Sarcopenia is a prevalent, consequential condition that can be diagnosed with DEXA and functional testing. Early identification enables intervention with resistance training and nutrition optimization to preserve muscle mass, function, and independence.
