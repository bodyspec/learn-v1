# Intervention & Monitoring

## Overview

Sarcopenia is treatable. While section one covered what sarcopenia is and how to identify it, this section focuses on what to do about it—and how to track whether interventions are working. The evidence is clear: structured resistance training combined with protein optimization can meaningfully improve muscle mass, strength, and function in older adults with sarcopenia. DEXA provides the objective monitoring data to evaluate progress, but interpreting serial scans requires an understanding of measurement precision and realistic timelines. This section equips providers with evidence-based protocols for exercise, nutrition, DEXA monitoring, and clinical decision-making during sarcopenia management.

## Evidence-Based Exercise

### Resistance Training Protocols

Resistance training is the only intervention with strong (Level 1) evidence for sarcopenia management. Both the EWGSOP2 consensus and the International Clinical Practice Guidelines for Sarcopenia (ICFSR) strongly recommend it as first-line treatment[^1][^2].

Specific prescription parameters based on recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses:

| Variable | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Frequency** | 2-3 sessions/week | Effective range: 2-5x/week; 2-3 balances stimulus with recovery |
| **Intensity** | 60-80% of 1RM | Optimal range for muscle hypertrophy; >80% increases injury risk |
| **Sets x Reps** | 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps | Hypertrophy range; manageable volume for older adults |
| **Duration** | Minimum 12 weeks | 12-24 weeks optimal for measurable outcomes |
| **Session length** | Minimum 30 minutes | Sufficient for 6-8 compound exercises |
| **Muscle groups** | All major groups | Compound movements (squat, press, row) preferred |
| **Progression** | Progressive overload | Increase load as tolerated—this is essential for continued adaptation |

*Exercise prescription parameters from Lopez et al. (2022) and Kim et al. (2025).*[^3][^4]

:::clinical
Progressive overload is non-negotiable. Simply repeating the same exercises at the same intensity produces diminishing returns. Patients should increase weight, reps, or sets systematically as their strength improves—even small increments matter.
:::

For frail patients who cannot tolerate higher intensities, low-load resistance training (up to 50% 1RM) still improves muscle strength. Elastic band training performed 3 times per week for 12 or more weeks shows meaningful effects on muscle mass, making it a practical entry point for patients who are intimidated by gym settings or have significant functional limitations[^4].

### Multicomponent Programming

Resistance training should not happen in isolation. The EWGSOP2 consensus recommends multicomponent exercise programs that combine resistance training with aerobic exercise and balance training[^1]. This combined approach is most effective for physical function improvements—gait speed, balance, and fall prevention—even though resistance training alone produces the greatest muscle mass gains.

A practical multicomponent prescription for sarcopenic older adults:

- **Resistance training:** 2-3 sessions per week (as prescribed above)
- **Aerobic exercise:** 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity (walking, cycling, swimming)
- **Balance training:** Incorporated into resistance sessions or as separate brief sessions
- **Flexibility:** Gentle stretching after exercise sessions

For patients new to exercise, starting with two sessions per week and building gradually over 4-6 weeks improves adherence and reduces injury risk.

## Nutrition for Muscle Health

### Protein Optimization

Older adults need more protein than younger adults to achieve the same muscle protein synthesis response—a phenomenon called **anabolic resistance**. The PROT-AGE Study Group and ESPEN Expert Group provide specific targets[^5][^6]:

| Population | Daily Protein Target | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Healthy older adults | 1.0-1.2 g/kg/day | Above the general RDA of 0.8 g/kg/day to offset anabolic resistance |
| Older adults with sarcopenia | 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day | Higher requirements during active treatment |
| During active resistance training | 1.2-1.6 g/kg/day | Supports exercise-induced muscle protein synthesis |

:::clinical
Per-meal protein distribution is as important as total daily intake. Each meal should include 25-30g of protein with 3-4g of leucine to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. This leucine threshold is higher in older adults (~3-4g) than in younger adults (~2g). Meals with less than 20g of protein produce minimal anabolic response in older adults.
:::

**Leucine-rich protein sources:** Whey protein, eggs, lean meat, dairy, and soy provide the highest leucine content per serving. Whey protein is particularly effective because it is rapidly digested and has the highest leucine content of common protein sources.

**Practical guidance:** Distribute protein evenly across three or more meals rather than concentrating intake at dinner, which is the common pattern. Many older adults consume inadequate protein at breakfast and lunch while exceeding needs at dinner—a pattern that leaves anabolic potential unrealized at two of three meals.

### Supplementary Nutrients

**Vitamin D:** 800-1,000 IU per day is recommended when serum 25(OH)D is below 30 ng/mL. Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in older adults (40-100% prevalence depending on setting) and impairs muscle function. The ICFSR does not recommend vitamin D supplementation alone for sarcopenia, but correction of deficiency is standard of care and provides a necessary foundation for other interventions[^2].

**Creatine monohydrate:** 3-5 g per day combined with resistance training augments lean tissue mass by 0.9-1.3 kg and upper-body strength beyond resistance training alone. Growing evidence supports creatine supplementation in older adults specifically, with no adverse effects on kidney or liver function documented in clinical trials[^7]. Creatine works by increasing intracellular phosphocreatine stores, reducing protein degradation, and promoting satellite cell activation.

:::note
Creatine is not yet included in formal sarcopenia guidelines (ICFSR, EWGSOP2) but the evidence base is growing rapidly. It is inexpensive, well-tolerated, and safe—making it a reasonable addition for motivated patients engaged in resistance training.
:::

## DEXA Monitoring Protocol

### Tracking Progress

Serial DEXA scans quantify changes in muscle mass during sarcopenia intervention, but effective monitoring requires understanding what to measure and how to interpret the results.

**Primary metrics to track at each scan:**

| Metric | Clinical Significance | EWGSOP2 Cut-Points |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **ALM** (Appendicular Lean Mass) | Total lean mass in arms + legs; proxy for skeletal muscle | Track absolute kg trends |
| **ALMI** (ALM/height²) | Height-normalized ALM; primary EWGSOP2 diagnostic metric | Men <7.0 kg/m², Women <5.5 kg/m² |
| **ALM/BMI** | BMI-adjusted ALM; more appropriate for obese patients | Men <0.789, Women <0.512 |
| **Regional lean mass** | Per-limb breakdown identifies asymmetric loss | Compare left vs. right, upper vs. lower |
| **Body fat percentage** | Identifies sarcopenic obesity (high fat + low muscle) | Context-dependent |

**Pair DEXA with functional assessments** at every monitoring visit. DEXA measures mass; it does not measure strength or function. The EWGSOP2 framework requires both for diagnosis and monitoring:

| Test | What It Measures | Threshold for Impairment | MCID |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|------|
| **Grip strength** | Upper body strength | Men <27 kg, Women <16 kg | ~6.5 kg |
| **Gait speed** | Walking function | <0.8 m/s | 0.1 m/s |
| **SPPB** | Composite physical performance | Score ≤8 | 1 point |
| **Chair stand test** | Lower body strength/power | >15 seconds for 5 rises | Not well established |

:::note
MCID = Minimal Clinically Important Difference. Changes meeting or exceeding the MCID are considered clinically meaningful, even if small in absolute terms.
:::

### Minimum Detectable Change

Not every change on DEXA reflects a real change in muscle mass. Understanding measurement precision is essential for honest interpretation:

- **ALM precision:** Coefficient of variation (CV) ~0.93%
- **Least Significant Change (LSC):** ~500g for ALM (calculated as 2.77 × precision error at 95% confidence)
- **What this means:** An ALM change of less than approximately 500g may be within measurement noise and should not be interpreted as true gain or loss

LSC increases with higher BMI—obese patients require larger changes to be confident the change is real. For valid serial comparisons, scans should be performed on the **same machine, by the same technologist, at the same time of day**, following the same pre-scan protocol[^8].

**Recommended monitoring frequency:**

| Clinical Scenario | Scan Interval | Rationale |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Active intervention (new exercise + nutrition) | 6-12 months | Minimum time for measurable lean mass change beyond LSC |
| Stable patient, monitoring for decline | 12 months | Annual trending to catch accelerated loss |
| High-risk (rapid weight loss, GLP-1 therapy) | 6 months | More frequent to detect disproportionate muscle loss |
| Post-intervention follow-up | 12 months | Confirm maintenance of gains |

:::warning
The existing general guidance of "every 3-6 months during active intervention" may be too frequent for DEXA-based lean mass monitoring. At 3 months, most patients will not have gained enough lean mass to exceed the LSC (~500g). Functional tests (grip strength, gait speed) can and should be repeated at 3-month intervals, but DEXA is more informative at 6 months or longer.
:::

## Expected Outcomes

### Realistic Timelines

Setting realistic expectations is essential for patient engagement and clinical decision-making. The following ranges reflect evidence from randomized controlled trials in sarcopenic older adults[^3][^9]:

| Intervention | Expected Lean Mass Change | Timeframe |
|-------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Resistance training alone | +0.5 to 1.0 kg | 12 weeks |
| RT + protein optimization | +0.7 to 1.8 kg | 12-24 weeks |
| RT + creatine | +0.9 to 1.3 kg above RT alone | 12 weeks |
| RT + protein + creatine (best case) | +2.0 to 3.1 kg | 12-24 weeks |
| No intervention (natural decline) | -0.5 to -1.0 kg per year after age 60 | Annual |

**Critical framing:** Strength and function improve *before* and *more reliably than* lean mass on DEXA. A patient may show significant improvements in grip strength (2-5 kg gain) and gait speed (0.05-0.15 m/s improvement) at 12 weeks while their DEXA lean mass change remains within the LSC. This does not mean the intervention has failed—it means the neural and functional adaptations are outpacing hypertrophy, which is expected.

### Functional Improvements

Functional gains are often more meaningful to patients than mass changes:

- **Grip strength:** 2-5 kg improvement typical with 12-24 weeks of resistance training
- **Gait speed:** 0.05-0.15 m/s improvement (clinically meaningful if ≥0.1 m/s)
- **Chair stand time:** 1-3 second reduction
- **SPPB score:** 0.5-1.5 point improvement (clinically meaningful if ≥1 point)
- **Strength gains:** Lower-body strength (leg press, knee extension) typically improves 20-40% with progressive resistance training

Interpreting serial DEXA alongside functional data:

- **Improvement:** ALM increase ≥500g (exceeds LSC) plus improved functional tests
- **Stability (success):** ALM within ±500g and stable or improved function—this counts as a win, because it means the expected 3-8% per decade loss has been arrested
- **Concern:** ALM decrease >500g despite intervention, or functional decline
- **Red flag:** ALM decrease >1 kg over 6-12 months despite adherent intervention

## When to Escalate

### Red Flags

The following findings during monitoring warrant further investigation and potential referral beyond primary care[^2][^10]:

| Red Flag | Possible Cause | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| ALM loss >1 kg in 6-12 months despite adherent intervention | Occult malignancy, cachexia, endocrine disorder | Full workup: labs (CK, TSH, testosterone, CMP), imaging |
| Unexplained weight loss >5% in 6-12 months | Cancer, hyperthyroidism, depression, GI malabsorption | Comprehensive medical evaluation |
| New-onset proximal weakness (difficulty rising from chair, lifting arms) | Inflammatory myopathy, statin myopathy, endocrine myopathy | CK, ESR/CRP, thyroid panel, medication review |
| Asymmetric muscle loss | Neurological cause (stroke, neuropathy, radiculopathy) | Neurological referral |
| Declining function despite gaining lean mass | Myopathy, neurological disease | Specialist referral |
| Frequent falls (new or worsening) | Multifactorial—sarcopenia + other contributors | Fall risk assessment, PT referral |

:::warning
Primary (age-related) sarcopenia is gradual, bilateral, and symmetric. It correlates with age, inactivity, and poor nutrition, and it responds to exercise and nutrition intervention. If a patient's muscle loss is rapid, asymmetric, or unresponsive to adherent intervention, consider secondary causes: cachexia (disease-associated wasting), endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, Cushing syndrome), inflammatory myopathy, drug-induced myopathy (statins affect 5-10% of users), or neuromuscular disease.
:::

### Differential Diagnosis

Distinguishing primary sarcopenia from secondary causes is a critical clinical skill:

- **Cachexia** presents with involuntary weight loss, systemic inflammation, and poor appetite. Unlike sarcopenia alone, cachexia involves weight loss plus muscle loss.
- **Statin myopathy** is the most common drug-induced cause. Presentation ranges from mild myalgia to significant weakness. Prevalence is 5-10% of statin users.
- **Inflammatory myopathy** (polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis) presents with proximal weakness and elevated CK. Requires rheumatology referral.
- **Endocrine disorders** (hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, growth hormone deficiency) are treatable once identified. Screen with appropriate labs.

**When to refer beyond primary care:** No improvement in strength or function after 3-6 months of adherent exercise plus nutrition; suspected secondary cause; severe sarcopenia not responding to intervention; or patients on GLP-1 therapy with disproportionate lean mass loss.

## Summary

Sarcopenia management rests on two evidence-based pillars: structured resistance training (2-3 sessions per week, 60-80% 1RM, progressive overload) and protein optimization (1.2-1.5 g/kg/day, distributed as 25-30g per meal with adequate leucine). Creatine supplementation and vitamin D repletion provide additional benefit. Serial DEXA monitoring every 6-12 months quantifies lean mass changes, but providers must account for measurement precision—changes below approximately 500g may not reflect true change. Functional assessments (grip strength, gait speed, SPPB) complement DEXA by capturing the strength and performance improvements that typically precede measurable hypertrophy. When patients show red flags—rapid muscle loss, asymmetric loss, or failure to respond despite adherence—investigation for secondary causes and specialist referral are warranted.
