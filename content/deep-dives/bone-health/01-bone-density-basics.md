# Bone Density Basics

<!-- TODO: This is a placeholder document. Full content needed. -->

## Overview

<!-- TODO: Write introduction clarifying body comp vs BMD DEXA -->

DEXA technology is used for both body composition analysis and bone mineral density (BMD) measurement, but these are different scans with different clinical applications. Understanding this distinction helps providers counsel patients appropriately.

## Two Types of DEXA Scans

<!-- TODO: Expand comparison -->

### Body Composition DEXA (What BodySpec Provides)
- **Purpose**: Measure fat mass, lean mass, bone mineral content
- **Scan area**: Whole body
- **Output**: Body fat %, lean mass, regional breakdown, VAT
- **Bone data**: Total body bone mineral content (BMC)
- **NOT for**: Diagnosing osteoporosis

### Clinical BMD DEXA (Medical Bone Density)
- **Purpose**: Screen for and diagnose osteoporosis
- **Scan sites**: Lumbar spine (L1-L4), hip (femoral neck, total hip)
- **Output**: T-scores, Z-scores at specific sites
- **For**: Osteoporosis diagnosis, fracture risk assessment
- **Requires**: Clinical DEXA facility, physician order

:::warning
Body composition DEXA cannot diagnose osteoporosis. Patients concerned about bone health should be referred for site-specific clinical BMD testing.

## What Body Comp DEXA Shows About Bone

<!-- TODO: Expand interpretation guidance -->

### Total Body Bone Mineral Content
- Measured in grams
- General indicator of bone mass
- Can track trends over time
- NOT diagnostic for osteoporosis

### Age/Sex Percentiles
- Compares to reference population
- Very low percentiles may warrant investigation
- Should prompt BMD referral, not diagnosis

### Limitations
- Doesn't measure specific fracture-risk sites
- No T-score calculation
- Different precision than clinical BMD
- Can't guide osteoporosis treatment

## When to Recommend Clinical BMD

<!-- TODO: Add screening criteria -->

### USPSTF Screening Recommendations
- Women ≥65 years
- Postmenopausal women <65 with risk factors
- Men ≥70 years (some guidelines)

<!-- CITATION NEEDED: Current USPSTF osteoporosis screening guidelines -->

### Risk Factors Prompting Earlier Screening
- Prolonged corticosteroid use
- Family history of osteoporosis or hip fracture
- Low body weight
- Smoking
- Excessive alcohol use
- Certain medical conditions (RA, celiac, hyperthyroidism)

### From Body Comp DEXA Findings
- Very low bone mineral content percentile (<10th)
- Unexpectedly low bone mass for age
- Declining bone mineral on serial scans

## Patient Communication

### Common Questions

**"Does this scan check my bone density?"**
> "This scan measures your total bone mineral content, which is useful for tracking trends. However, it's different from a clinical bone density test. If you're concerned about osteoporosis, I'd recommend talking to your doctor about a site-specific bone density scan."

**"My bone number seems low—do I have osteoporosis?"**
> "Body composition DEXA can't diagnose osteoporosis. Your result shows your total bone mineral relative to others your age. If it's concerning, it's worth discussing with your doctor who can order the right test if needed."

**"Can I use this instead of a bone density test?"**
> "No, they serve different purposes. This scan is great for tracking body composition, but osteoporosis diagnosis requires a clinical BMD scan of your spine and hip. Both use DEXA technology, but they're measuring different things."

## Understanding the Results

<!-- TODO: Add interpretation section -->

### What You'll See
- Total body bone mineral content (grams)
- Age/sex percentile ranking
- Regional bone mineral (arms, legs, trunk)

### What It Means
- Provides general bone health indicator
- Useful for longitudinal tracking
- Lower values may warrant medical evaluation
- Cannot replace clinical BMD testing

## Summary

<!-- TODO: Write summary -->

Body composition DEXA provides valuable information about total body bone mineral content, but it serves a different purpose than clinical BMD testing. Providers should understand this distinction to appropriately counsel patients and make referrals when osteoporosis screening is indicated.
