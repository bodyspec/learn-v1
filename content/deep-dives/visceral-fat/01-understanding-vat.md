# Visceral Fat: Beyond the Basics

<!-- TODO: This is a placeholder document. Full content needed. -->

## Overview

<!-- TODO: Write introduction explaining why VAT deserves its own deep dive -->

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is metabolically active fat stored around abdominal organs. Unlike subcutaneous fat, VAT has direct implications for metabolic health.

## Why VAT Matters More Than Total Body Fat

<!-- TODO: Expand with research on VAT vs subcutaneous fat metabolic activity -->

### Metabolic Activity
- VAT releases inflammatory cytokines
- Direct portal vein drainage to liver
- Insulin resistance connection

<!-- CITATION NEEDED: Studies on VAT inflammatory markers -->

### The Disconnect from BMI

<!-- TODO: Add statistics on VAT variation at same BMI -->
<!-- IMAGE: ../assets/diagrams/dexa-vs-bmi.svg showing same BMI, different VAT -->

## DEXA Measurement of VAT

<!-- TODO: Explain how DEXA estimates VAT compared to CT gold standard -->

### How DEXA Measures VAT
- Android region analysis
- Algorithm derivation from total abdominal fat
- Correlation with CT measurements

<!-- CITATION NEEDED: DEXA VAT validation against CT -->

### VAT Thresholds

| Level | VAT (cm²) | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Normal | <100 | Low metabolic risk |
| Elevated | 100-160 | Moderate risk, intervention recommended |
| High | >160 | High risk, aggressive intervention |
| Severely elevated | >200 | Very high risk, medical evaluation |

<!-- CITATION NEEDED: Source for these threshold values -->

## VAT and Disease Risk

<!-- TODO: Expand each section with specific data -->

### Cardiovascular Disease
- Association with coronary artery disease
- Impact on lipid profiles
- Blood pressure effects

### Type 2 Diabetes
- Insulin resistance mechanisms
- Prediabetes progression risk
- Independent of total body fat

### Metabolic Syndrome
- VAT as central feature
- Interaction with other components

<!-- CITATION NEEDED: Prospective studies on VAT and disease outcomes -->

## Who Should Pay Attention to VAT?

<!-- TODO: Write clinical guidance on which patients need VAT focus -->

### High-Priority Populations
1. Normal-weight individuals with metabolic abnormalities
2. Family history of type 2 diabetes
3. Patients with elevated triglycerides despite normal BMI
4. Post-menopausal women
5. Men with "apple" body shape
