# Strategies for Muscle Preservation

<!-- TODO: This is a placeholder document. Full content needed. -->

## Overview

<!-- TODO: Write introduction -->

When patients on GLP-1 medications show concerning lean mass loss, evidence-based interventions can help preserve muscle while maintaining the metabolic benefits of weight loss.

## Protein Optimization

<!-- TODO: Expand with specific guidance -->

### Requirements During Weight Loss
- Standard: 0.8 g/kg body weight
- During weight loss: 1.2-1.6 g/kg body weight
- Active weight loss + exercise: 1.6-2.0 g/kg

<!-- CITATION NEEDED: Protein requirements during pharmacological weight loss -->

### Practical Challenges
- Reduced appetite from medication
- Early satiety
- Food aversions

### Strategies
1. **Prioritize protein** at each meal
2. **Protein timing**: 25-30g per meal minimum
3. **Supplementation** if food intake inadequate
4. **Leucine-rich sources**: whey, eggs, lean meat

## Exercise Prescription

<!-- TODO: Add exercise protocols -->

### Resistance Training
- **Critical** for muscle preservation
- 2-3 sessions per week minimum
- Progressive overload when possible
- Focus on major muscle groups

<!-- CITATION NEEDED: Resistance training during GLP-1 therapy -->

### Recommended Protocol

| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Frequency | 2-3x per week |
| Exercises | Compound movements (squat, deadlift, press, row) |
| Sets/Reps | 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps |
| Progression | Increase weight when 12 reps achieved |

### Aerobic Exercise
- Supports overall health and VAT reduction
- Should complement, not replace, resistance training
- 150 min/week moderate or 75 min/week vigorous

## Medication Considerations

<!-- TODO: Expand with clinical guidance -->

### Dose Adjustments
- Slower titration may allow adaptation
- Temporary dose reduction if severe muscle loss
- Risk-benefit discussion with prescriber

### Timing Considerations
- Exercise timing relative to injection
- Meal timing to maximize protein synthesis

## Monitoring Success

<!-- TODO: Add monitoring framework -->

### DEXA Follow-up
- Recheck at 3-month intervals during active intervention
- Track lean mass trajectory
- Assess regional changes (appendicular lean mass)

### Functional Assessments
- Grip strength
- Chair stand test
- Gait speed
- Patient-reported function

### Success Metrics
- Lean mass loss <30% of total weight loss
- Maintained or improved functional measures
- Continued fat loss and VAT reduction

## When to Escalate

<!-- TODO: Add escalation criteria -->

### Red Flags
- Lean mass loss >40% of total loss
- Functional decline
- Approaching sarcopenia thresholds
- Unable to maintain protein/exercise

### Escalation Options
1. Dietitian referral
2. Physical therapy/exercise physiologist
3. Prescriber discussion re: medication adjustment
4. Consider temporary medication hold if severe

## Patient Education

<!-- TODO: Add patient communication -->

### Key Messages
- "Weight loss is good, but how you lose it matters"
- "Muscle is your metabolic engine—we want to protect it"
- "Exercise and protein aren't optional extras"

### Motivation
- Frame as optimizing investment in medication
- Long-term weight maintenance requires muscle
- Quality of life depends on functional capacity
