# Monitoring Weight Loss Quality

<!-- TODO: This is a placeholder document. Full content needed. -->

## Overview

<!-- TODO: Write introduction on GLP-1 medications and body composition -->

GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide) produce significant weight loss, but the composition of that weight loss matters for long-term health outcomes.

## Why Body Composition Monitoring Matters

<!-- TODO: Expand on importance -->

### The Muscle Loss Concern
- Weight loss typically includes 20-40% lean mass
- GLP-1 medications may accelerate this ratio
- Long-term implications for metabolism and function

<!-- CITATION NEEDED: GLP-1 body composition studies (STEP trials, SURMOUNT trials) -->

### What the Research Shows

| Study | Medication | Weight Loss | Lean Mass Loss |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| STEP 1 | Semaglutide 2.4mg | ~15% | ~40% of loss |
| SURMOUNT-1 | Tirzepatide | ~20% | ~33% of loss |

## Using DEXA to Monitor

<!-- TODO: Expand clinical guidance -->

### Recommended Protocol
1. **Baseline scan** before starting medication
2. **Follow-up at 3-6 months** to assess composition
3. **Continued monitoring** every 6 months during treatment

### What to Track
- Total weight vs fat mass vs lean mass
- Percentage of loss from each compartment
- Regional lean mass (appendicular for sarcopenia risk)
- VAT changes (often favorable)

## Interpreting Results

<!-- TODO: Add interpretation framework -->

### Favorable Pattern
- ≥60% of weight loss from fat mass
- Lean mass stable or modest decline (<20% of total loss)
- VAT decreasing
- Maintained muscle function

### Concerning Pattern
- >40% of weight loss from lean mass
- Rapid lean mass decline
- Functional decline (weakness, fatigue)
- ALM approaching sarcopenia thresholds

:::warning
Patients losing significant lean mass may need intervention adjustments, not medication discontinuation. See strategies in the next section.

## Special Populations

<!-- TODO: Expand each population -->

### Older Adults (>65)
- Higher baseline sarcopenia risk
- More vigilant monitoring needed
- Lower threshold for intervention

### Previously Sedentary
- Limited muscle reserve
- May benefit from supervised exercise program

### Rapid Weight Losers
- >1% body weight per week
- Higher risk of disproportionate muscle loss

## Communicating with Patients

<!-- TODO: Add communication guidance -->

### Framing the Conversation
- "We want to make sure you're losing the right kind of weight"
- "Your muscle mass is important for long-term health"
- "This scan helps us optimize your treatment"

### Setting Expectations
- Some lean mass loss is normal
- Goal is optimization, not perfection
- Lifestyle factors significantly influence composition
